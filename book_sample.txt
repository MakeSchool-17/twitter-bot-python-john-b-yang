This excitement was not confined to merchants, common  sailors, sea-captains, shippers, and naval officers of all  countries, but the governments of many states on the two  continents were deeply interested.   The excitement was caused by a long, spindle-shaped, and  sometimes phosphorescent object, much larger than a whale.   The different accounts that were written of this object in  various log-books agreed generally as to its structure, won-  derful speed, and the peculiar life with which it appeared  endowed. If it was a cetacean it surpassed in bulk all those  that had hitherto been classified ; neither Cuvier, Lacepede,  M. Dumeril, nor M. de Quatrefages would have admitted  the existence of such a monster, unless he had seen it with  his own scientific eyes.   By taking the average of observations made at different  times rejecting the timid estimates that assigned to this  object a length of 200 feet, as well as the exaggerated  opinions which made it out to be a mile in width and three  in length we may fairly affirm that it surpassed all the  dimensions allowed by the ichthyologists of the day, if it  existed at all. It did exist, that was undeniable, and with  that leaning towards the marvellous that characterises  humanity, we cannot wonder at the excitement it produced  in the entire world.   On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer Governor Higgen-  son, of the Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Com-  pany, met this moving mass five miles off the east coast of  Australia. Captain Baker thought at first that he was in  presence of an unknown reef ; he was preparing to take its     8 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   exact position, when two columns of water, projected by the  inexplicable object, went hissing up a hundred and fifty feet  into the air. Unless there was an intermittent geysern on the  reef, the Governor Higgenson had to do with some aquatic  mammal, unknown till then, which threw out columns of  water mixed with air and vapour from its blow-holes.   A similar occurrence happened on the 23rd of July in the  same year to the Columbus, of the West India and Pacific  Steam Navigation Company, in the Pacific Ocean. It was,  therefore, evident that this extraordinary cetaceous crea-  ture could transport itself from one place to another with  surprising velocity, seeing there was but an interval of  three days between the two observations, separated by a  distance of more than 700 nautical leagues.   Fifteen days later, two thousand leagues from the last  place it was seen by the Helvetia, of the Compagnie Nation-  ale, and the Shannon of the Royal Mail Steamship Company,  in the Atlantic. As the Shannon and Helvetia were of  smaller dimensions than the object, though they measured  300 feet over all, the minimum length of the mammal was  estimated at more than 350 feet. Now the largest whales  are never more than sixty yards long, if so long.   These accounts arrived one after another ; fresh obser-  vations made on board the transatlantic ship Le Pereire,  the running foul of the monster by the Etna, of the Inman  line ; a report drawn up by the officers of the French frigate  La Normandie ; a very grave statement made by the ship's  officers of the Commodore Fitzjames on board the Lord  Clyde, deeply stirred public opinion.   The monster became the topic of the day ; it was dis-  cussed at length gravely and humorously in all the news-  papers.   For six months the discussion went on with varying  success. Finally, a popular writer in a leading satirical  journal, hurried over the whole ground, reached the monster,  like Hippolytus gave him his finishing blow, and killed him  in the midst of a universal burst of laughter. Wit had  conquered science.   During the first months of the year 1867 the question  seemed to be buried out of sight and mind, when some     UNDER THE SEA 9   fresh facts brought it again before the public notice. The  question took another phase. The monster again became  an island or rock. On the 5th of March, 1867, the Moravian,  of the Montreal Ocean Company, being, during the night,  in 27 30' lat. and 72 15' long., struck her starboard quarter  on a rock which no chart gave in that point. She was then  going at the rate of thirteen knots under the combined  efforts of the wind and her 400 horse power. Had it not  been for the more than ordinary strength of the hull she  would have been broken by the shock, and have gone down  with the 237 passengers she was bringing from Canada.   The accident happened about 5 a.m. at daybreak. The  officers on watch hurried aft and looked at the sea with the  most scrupulous attention. They saw nothing except  what looked like a strong eddy, three cables' length off,  as if the waves had been violently agitated. The bearings  of the place were taken exactly, and the Moravian went on  her way without apparent damage. Had she struck on a  submarine rock or some enormous fragment of wreck ?  They could not find out, but during the examination made  of the ship's bottom when under repair it was found that  part of her keel was broken.   This fact, extremely grave in itself, would perhaps have  been forgotten, like so many others, if three weeks after-  wards it had not happened again under identical circum-  stances, only, thanks to the nationality of the ship that was  this time victim of the shock, and the reputation of the  company to which the vessel belonged, the circumstance  was immensely commented upon.   On the I3th of April, 1867, by a smooth sea and favour-  able breeze, the Cunard steamer Scotia was in 15 12' long.  and 45 37' lat. She was going at the rate of thirteen  knots an hour under the pressure of her 1,000 horse power.   At 4.17 p.m., as the passengers were assembled at dinner  in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on the hull of the  Scotia, on her quarter a little aft of the paddle. It was so  slight that no one on board would have been uneasy at it  had it not been for the carpenter's watch, who rushed upon  deck, calling out  She is sinking ! she is sinking !    At first the passengers were much alarmed, but Captain     io TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Anderson hastened to reassure them that danger could not  be imminent, as the ship was divided into seven air-tight  compartments, and could with impunity brave any leak.   Captain Anderson went down immediately into the hold  and found that a leak had sprung in the fifth compartment,  and the sea was rushing in rapidly. He ordered the  engines to be immediately stopped, and one of the sailors  dived to ascertain the extent of the damage. Some minutes  after it was found that there was a hole about two yards in  diameter in the ship's bottom. Such a leak could not be  stopped, and the Scotia, with her paddles half submerged,  was obliged to continue her voyage. She was then 300  miles from Cape Clear, and after three days' delay, which  caused great anxiety in Liverpool, she entered the com-  pany's docks.   The engineers then proceeded to examine her in the dry  dock, where she had been placed. They could scarcely  believe their eyes ; at two yards and a half below water-  mark was a regular rent in the shape of an isosceles triangle.  The place where the piece had been taken out of the iron  plates was so sharply defined that it could not have been  done more neatly by a punch. The perforating instrument  that had done the work was of no common stamp, for  after having been driven with prodigious force, and pierc-  ing an iron plate one and three-eighths of an inch thick,  it had been withdrawn by some wonderful retrograde  movement.   Such was the last fact, and it again awakened public  opinion on the subject.   CHAPTER II   FOR AND AGAINST   AT the time when these events were happening I was  returning from a scientific expedition into the disagreeable  region of Nebraska, in the United States. In my capacity  of Assistant Professor in the Paris Museum of Natural  History, the French Government had attached me to that  expedition. I arrived, at the end of March, at New York,  loaded with precious collections made during six months  in Nebraska. My departure from France was fixed for     UNDER THE SEA u   the beginning of May. Whilst I waited and was occupying  myself with classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and  zoological riches, the incident happened to the Scotia.   I was perfectly acquainted with the subject which was  the topic of the day. I had repeatedly read all the American  and European papers without being any the wiser as to  the cause. The mystery puzzled me, and I hesitated to  form any conclusion.   When I arrived at New York the subject was hot. The  hypothesis of a floating island or reef was quite abandoned,  for unless the shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could  it change its position with such marvellous rapidity ? For  the same reason the idea of a floating huh 1 or gigantic wreck  was given up.   There remained, therefore, two possible solutions of the  enigma which created two distinct parties ; one was that  the object was a colossal monster, the other that it was a  submarine vessel of enormous motive power. This last  hypothesis, which, after all, was admissible, could not stand  against inquiries made in the two hemispheres. It was  hardly probable that a private individual should possess  such a machine. Where and when had he caused it to be  built, and how could he have kept its construction secret ?  Certainly a government might possess such a destructive  engine, and it was possible in these disastrous times, when  the power of weapons of war has been multiplied, that,  without the knowledge of others, a state might possess  so formidable a weapon. After the chassepots came the  torpedoes, and after the torpedoes the submarine rams,  and after them the reaction. At least, I hope so.   But the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the  declaration of different governments, and as the public  interest suffered from the difficulty of transatlantic com-  munication, their veracity could not be doubted. Besides,  secrecy would be even more difficult to a government than  to a private individual. After inquiries made in England,  France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy, America, and even  Turkey, the hypothesis of a submarine monster was defi-  nitely rejected.   On my arrival at New York, several persons did     12 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   me the honour of consulting me about the pheno-  menon. I had published in France a quarto work in two  volumes, called The Mysteries of the Great Submarine  Grounds. This book made some sensation in the scientific  world, and gained me a special reputation in this rather  obscure branch of Natural History. As long as I could  deny the reality of the fact I kept to a decided negative,  but I was soon driven into a corner, and was obliged  to explain myself categorically. The Honourable Pierre  Aronnax, Professor in the Paris Museum, was asked by the  New York Herald to give his opinion on the matter. I  subjoin an extract from the article which I published on the  30th of April :    After having examined the different hypotheses one by  one, and all other suppositions being rejected, the existence  of a marine animal of excessive strength must be admitted.    The greatest depths of the ocean are totally unknown  to us. What happens there ? What beings can live twelve  or fifteen miles below the surface of the sea ? We can  scarcely conjecture what the organisation of these animals is.  However the solution of the problem submitted to me may  affect the form of the dilemma, we either know all the  varieties of beings that people our planet or we do not. If  we do not know them all if there are still secrets of sub-  marine life for us nothing is more reasonable than to  admit the existence of fishes or cetaceans of an organisation  suitable to the strata inaccessible to soundings, which for  some reason or other come up to the surface at intervals.    If, on the contrary, we do know all living species, we  must of course look for the animal in question amongst the  already classified marine animals, and in that case I should  be disposed to admit the existence of a gigantic narwhal.    The common narwhal, or sea-unicorn, is often sixty feet  long. This size increases five or tenfold, and a strength in  proportion to its size being given to the cetacean, and its  offensive arms being increased in the same proportion, you  obtain the animal required. It will have the proportions  given by the officers of the Shannon, the instrument that  perforated the Scotia, and the strength necessary to pierce  the hull of the steamer.     UNDER THE SEA 13    In fact, the narwhal is armed with a kind of ivory  sword or halberd, as some naturalists call it. It is the  principal tusk, and is as hard as steel. Some of these tusks  have been found imbedded in the bodies of whales, which  the narwhal always attacks with success. Others have  been with difficulty taken out of ships' bottoms, which they  pierced through and through like a gimlet in a barrel. The  Museum of the Paris Faculty of Medicine contains one of  these weapons, two and a quarter yards in length and  fifteen inches in diameter at the base.    Now suppose this weapon to be ten times stronger, and  its possessor ten times more powerful, hurl it at the rate of  twenty miles an hour, and you obtain a shock that might  produce the catastrophe required. Therefore, until I get  fuller information, I shall suppose it to be a sea-unicorn of  colossal dimensions, armed, not with a halberd, but with a  spur like ironclads or battering rams, the massiveness and  motive power of which it would possess at the same time.  This inexplicable phenomenon may be thus explained,  unless something exists over and above anything ever con-  jectured, seen, or experienced, which is just possible.   The last words were cowardly on my part, but I wished  up to a certain point to cover my dignity as professor, and  not to give too much cause of laughter to the Americans,  who laugh well when they do laugh. I reserved myself a  loophole of escape, and, in fact, admitted the existence of  the monster.   My article was well received, and provoked much dis-  cussion amongst the public. It rallied a certain number of  partisans. The solution which it proposed left freedom  to the imagination. The human mind likes these grand  conceptions of supernatural beings. Now the sea is the  only medium in which these giants, by the side of which  terrestrial animals, elephants or rhinoceri, are but dwarfs,  can breed and develop. The liquid masses transport  the largest known species of mammalia, and they  perhaps contain molluscs of enormous size, crustaceans  frightful to contemplate, such as lobsters more than a  hundred yards long, or crabs weighing two hundred tons.  Why should it not be so ? Formerly, terrestrial animals,     14 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   contemporaries of the geological epochs, quadrupeds,  quadrumans, reptiles, and birds, were constructed in gigan-  tic moulds. The Creator had thrown them into a colossal  mould which time has gradually lessened. Why should  not the sea in its unknown depths have kept there vast  specimens of the life of another age the sea which never  changes, whilst the earth changes incessantly ? Why  should it not hide in its bosom the last varieties of these  Titanic species, whose years are centuries, and whose  centuries are millenniums ?   But I am letting myself be carried away by reveries  which are no longer such to me. A truce to chimeras  which time has changed for me into terrible realities. I  repeat, opinion was then made up as to the nature of the  phenomenon, and the public admitted the existence of the  prodigious animal which had nothing in common with the  mythical sea serpents.   But if some people saw in this nothing but a purely  scientific problem to solve, others more positive, especially  in America and England, were of opinion to purge the ocean  of this formidable monster, in order to reassure transmarine  communications.   All papers devoted to insurance companies who threat-  ened to raise their rate of premium, were unanimous  on this point. Public opinion having declared its  verdict, the United States were first in the field, and pre-  parations for an expedition to pursue the narwhal were at  once begun in New York. A very fast frigate, the Abraham  Lincoln, was put in commission, and the arsenals were  opened to Captain Farragut, who hastened the arming of his  frigate.   But, as generally happens, from the moment it was  decided to pursue the monster, the monster was not heard  of for two months. It seemed as if this unicorn knew  about the plots that were being weaved for it. It had been  so much talked of, even through the Atlantic Cable !  Would-be wits pretended that the cunning fellow had  stopped some telegram in its passage, and was now using  the knowledge for his own benefit.   So when the frigate had been prepared for a long cam-     UNDER THE SEA 1.5   paign, and furnished with formidable fishing apparatus,  they did not know where to send her to. Impatience was  increasing with the delay, when on July 2nd it was reported  that a steamer of the San Francisco line, from California to  Shanghai, had met with the animal three weeks before in  the North Pacific Ocean.   The interest aroused by the news was intense, and  twenty-four hours only were granted to Captain Farragut  before he sailed.   Three hours before the Abraham Lincoln left Brooklyn  Pier I received the following letter :    To M. ARONNAX, Professor of the Paris Museum,   Fifth Avenue Hotel,    New York.    SIR, If you would like to join the expedition of the  Abraham Lincoln, the United States Government will have  great pleasure in seeing France represented by you in the  enterprise. Captain Farragut has a cabin at your disposi-  tion.  Faithfully yours,   J. B. HOBSON,  %  Secretary of Marine.   CHAPTER III   AS MONSIEUR PLEASES   THREE seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson's letter  I had no more idea of pursuing the unicorn than of attempt-  ing the North- West Passage. Three seconds after having  read the secretary's letter I had made up my mind that  ridding the world of this monster was my veritable vocation  and the single aim of my life.   But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, and was  longing for rest in my own little place in the Jardin des  Plantes amongst my dear and precious collections. But I  forgot all fatigue, repose and collections, and accepted  without further reflection the offer of the American Govern-  ment.    Besides, I said to myself,  all roads lead back to  Europe, and the unicorn may be amiable enough to draw  me towards the French coast. This worthy animal may     16 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   allow itself to be caught in European seas for my especial  benefit, and I will not take back less than half a yard of its  halberd to the Natural History Museum.   But in the meantime the narwhal was taking me to the  North Pacific Ocean, which was going to the antipodes on  the road to France.    Conseil !  I called in an impatient tone.  Conseil !    Conseil was my servant, a faithful fellow who accom-  panied me in all my journeys, a brave Dutchman I had great  confidence in ; he was phlegmatic by nature, regular from  principle, zealous from habit, showing little astonishment  at the varied surprises of life, very skilful with his hands,  and, in spite of his name, never giving any counsel, even  when not asked for it.   Through being brought in contact with men of science  in our Jardin des Plantes, Conseil had succeeded in knowing  something. He was a specialist, well up in the classifica-  tion of Natural History, but his science stopped there.  And yet what a brave fellow he was !   Conseil had followed me during the last ten years wher-  ever science had directed my steps. He never complained  of the length or fatigue of a journey, or of having to pack  his trunk for any country, however remote. He went there  or elsewhere without questioning the wherefore. His health  defied all illness, and he had slid muscles, but no nerves  not the least appearance of nerves of course I mean in his  mental faculties. He was thirty years old, and his age to  that of his master was as fifteen is to twenty. May I be  excused for saying that I was forty ?   But Conseil had one fault. He was intensely formal, and  would never speak to me except in the third person, which  was sometimes irritating.    Conseil 1  I repeated, beginning my preparations for  departure with a feverish hand.   Conseil appeared.   ' Did monsieur call me ?  said he on entering.   ' Yes, my boy. Get yourself and me ready to start in  two hours.   ' As it pleases monsieur, answered Conseil calmly.   ' There is not a minute to lose. Pack up all my travel-     UNDER THE SEA 17   ling utensils, as many coats, shirts and socks as you can get  in. Make haste !     And monsieur's collections ?  asked Conseil.    They will be attended to during our absence. Besides, I  will give orders to have our menagerie forwarded to France.    We are not going back to Paris, then ?  asked Conseil.    Yes certainly we are, answered I evasively ;  but  by making a curve.    The curve that monsieur pleases.    Oh, it is not much ; not so direct a route, that's all.  We are going in the Abraham Lincoln.    As it may suit monsieur.    You know about the monster, Conseil the famous  narwhal. We are going to rid the seas of it. The author  of the Great Submarine Grounds cannot do otherwise than  embark with Commander Farragut. A glorious mission,  but dangerous too. We don't know where we are going  to. Those animals may be very capricious ! But we will  go, whether or no ! We have a captain who will keep his  eyes open.    As monsieur does I will do, answered Conseil.    But think, for I will hide nothing from you. It is  one of those voyages from which people do not always come  back.    As monsieur pleases.   A quarter of an hour afterwards our trunks were ready.  Conseil had packed them by sleight of hand, and I was sure  nothing would be missing, for the fellow classified shirts and  clothes as well as he did birds or mammals.   The hotel lift deposited us in the large vestibule of the first  floor. I went down the few stairs that led to the ground  floor. I paid my bill at the vast counter, always besieged  by a busy crowd. I gave the order to send my cases of  stuffed animals and dried plants to Paris, where I had  instructed by telegraph my bankers to appoint a caretaker,  and without waiting for an answer, I sprang into a vehicle,  followed by Conseil.   The vehicle at fifteen shillings the course, descended  Broadway as far as Union Square, went along Fourth  avenue to its junction with Bowery Street, then along     18 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Katrin Street, and stopped at the thirty- fourth pier. There  the Katrin ferry-boat transported us, men, horses, and  vehicle, to Brooklyn, and in a few minutes we arrived at  the quay opposite which the Abraham Lincoln was pouring  forth clouds of black smoke from her two funnels.   Our luggage was at once sent on board, and we soon  followed it. I asked for Captain Farragut. One of the  sailors conducted me to the poop, where I found myself  in the presence of a pleasant-looking officer, who held out  his hand to me.    Monsieur Pierre Aronnax ?  he said.    Himself, replied I.  Do I see Captain Farragut ?     In person. You are welcome, professor. Your cabin  is ready for you.   I bowed and leaving the commander to his duties, went  down to the cabin which had been prepared for me.   The Abraham Lincoln had been well chosen and equipped  for her new destination. She was furnished with a heating  apparatus that allowed the tension of the steam to reach  seven atmospheres. Under that pressure the Abraham  Lincoln reached an average speed of eighteen miles and  three-tenths an hour good speed, but not enough to wrestle  with the gigantic cetacean.   The interior arrangements of the frigate were in keeping  with her nautical qualities. I was well satisfied with my  cabin, which was situated aft, and opened on the wardroom.    We shall be comfortable here, said I to Conseil.    Yes, as comfortable as a hermit crab in a crumpet-  shell.   I left Conseil to stow our luggage away, and went up on  deck in order to see the preparations for departure. Cap-  tain Farragut was just ordering the last moorings to be  cast loose, so that had I been one quarter of an hour later  the frigate would have started without me.   But Commander Farragut did not wish to loose either a  day or an hour before scouring the seas in which the animal  had just been signalled.   The Abraham Lincoln was soon moving majestically  amongst a hundred ferry-boats and tenders loaded with  spectators, past the Brooklyn quay, on which as well as on     UNDER THE SEA 19   all that part of New York bordering on the East River,  crowds of spectators were assembled. Thousands of hand-  kerchiefs were waved above the compact mass, and saluted  the Abraham Lincoln until she reached the Hudson at the  point of that elongated peninsula which forms the town of  New York.   Then the frigate followed the coast of New Jersey, along  the right bank of the beautiful river covered with villas,  and passed between the forts which saluted her with their  largest guns. The Abraham Lincoln acknowledged the  salutation by hoisting the American colours three times ;  then modifying her speed to take the narrow channel  marked by buoys and formed by Sandy Hook Point, she  coasted the long sandy shore, where several thousand  spectators saluted her once more.   Her escort of boats and tenders followed her till she  reached the lightboat, the two lights of which mark the  entrance to the New York Channel.   Three o'clock was then striking. The pilot went down  into his boat and rejoined the little schooner which was  waiting under lee, the fires were made up, the screw beat  the waves more rapidly, and the frigate coasted the low  yellow shore of Long Island, and at 8 p.m., after having lost  sight in the north-west of the lights on Fire Island, she ran  at full steam on to the dark waters of the Atlantic.   CHAPTER IV   NED LAND   CAPTAIN FARRAGUT was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate  he was commanding. His ship and he were one. He was  the soul of it. No doubt arose in his mind on the question  of the cetacean, and he did not allow the existence of the  animal to be disputed on board. He believed in it like  certain simple souls believe in the Leviathan by faith,  not by sight. The monster existed, and he had sworn to  capture it, dead or alive. Either Captain Farragut would  kill the narwhal or the narwhal would kill Captain Farragut  there was no middle course.   The officers on board shared the. opinion of their chief.     20 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   It was amusing to hear them talking, arguing, disputing and  calculating the different chances of meeting whilst they kept  a sharp look-out over the vast extent of ocean. More than  one took up his position on the crosstrees and would have  cursed the duty as a nuisance at any other time. And  nevertheless the Abraham Lincoln was not yet ploughing  with her stern the suspected waters of the Pacific.   As to the crew, all they wanted was to meet the unicorn,  harpoon it, haul it on board, and cut it up. Captain Farra-  gut had offered a reward of 2,000 dollars to the first cabin-  boy, sailor, or officer who should signal the animal. I have  already said that Captain Farragut had carefully provided  all the tackle necessary for taking the gigantic cetacean.  A whaler would not have been better furnished. We had  every known engine, from the hand harpoon to the barbed  arrow of the blunderbuss and the explosive bullets of the  deck-gun. On the forecastle lay a perfect breechloader  very thick at the breech and narrow in the bore, the model  of which had been in the Paris Exhibition of 1867. This  precious weapon, of American make, could throw Math ease  a projectile, weighing nine pounds, to a mean distance of  ten miles. Thus the Abraham Lincoln not only possessed  every means of destruction, but, better still, she had on  board Ned Land, the king of harpooners.   Ned Land was a Canadian who had no equal in his peril-  ous employment. He possessed ability, audacity, and  subtleness to a remarkable degree, and it would have taken  a sharp whale or a singularly wily cachalot to escape his  harpoon. He was about forty years of age, tall, strongly  built, grave, and taciturn, sometimes violent, and very  passionate when put out. His person, and especially the  power of his glance, which gave a singular expression to his  face, attracted attention.   I believe that Captain Farragut had done wisely in engag-  ing this man. He was worth all the rest of the ship's  company as far as his eye and arm went. I could not com-  pare him to anything better than a powerful telescope which  would be a cannon always ready to fire as well.   Ned Land was a descendant of French Canadians, and  although he was so little communicative, he took a sort of lik-     UNDER THE SEA 21   ing to me. My nationality, doubtless, attracted him. The  family of the harpooner came originally from Quebec, and  already formed a tribe of hardy fishermen when that town  belonged to France. Little by little Ned Land acquired a  liking for talk, and I was delighted to hear the recital of his  adventures in the Polar Seas.   I now depict this brave companion as I knew him after-  wards, for we are old friends united in that unchangeable  friendship which is born and cemented in mutual danger.   Now what was Ned Land's opinion on the subject of this  marine monster ? I must acknowledge that he hardly  believed in the narwhal, and that he was the only one on  board who did not share the universal conviction.   One magnificent evening, three weeks after our departure,  on the 3oth of July, the frigate was abreast of Cape Slanc,  thirty miles to leeward of the Patagonian coast. Another  week and the Abraham Lincoln would be ploughing -he  waters of the Pacific.   Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were talking on ill  sorts of subjects, looking at that mysterious sea whose  greatest depths have remained till now inaccessible f o the  eye of man. I brought the conversation naturally to the  subject of the giant unicorn, and discussed the different  chances of success in our expedition. Then seeing that Ned  Land let me go on talking without saying anything himself,  I pressed him more closely.    Well, Ned, I said to him,  are you not yet convinced  of the existence of the cetacean we are pursuing ? Have  you any particular reasons for being so incredulous ?    The harpooner looked at me for some minutes before  replying, struck his forehead with a gesture habitual to  him, shut his eyes as if to collect himself, and said at last    Perhaps I have, M. Aronnax.    Yet you, Ned, are a whaler by profession. You are  familiar with the great marine mammalia, and your imagi-  nation ought easily to accept the hypothesis of enormous  cetaceans. You ought to be the last to doubt in such cir-  cumstances.    That is what deceives you, sir, answered Ned.  It  is not strange that common people should believe in extra-     22 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   ordinary comets, or the existence of antediluvian monsters  peopling the interior of the globe, but no astronomer or  geologist would believe in such chimeras. The whaler is  the same. I have pursued many cataceans, harpooned a  great number, and killed some few ; but however powerful  or well armed they were, neither their tails nor their defences  could ever have made an incision in the iron plates of a  steamer.    Yet, Ned, it is said that ships have been bored through  by the tusk of a narwhal.    Wooden ships, perhaps, answered the Canadian,   though I have never seen it, and until I get proof to the  contrary I deny that whales, cachalots, or sea-unicorns  could produce such an effect.    Listen to me, Ned.    No, sir, no ; anything you like but that a gigantic  poulp, perhaps ?     No, that can't be. The poulp is only a mollusc ; its  flesh has no more consistency than its name indicates.    Then you really do believe in this cetacean, sir ?   said Ned.    Yes, Ned. I repeat it with a conviction resting on the  logic of facts. I believe in the existence of a mammal,  powerfully organised, belonging to the branch of vertebrata,  like whales, cachalots, and dolphins, and furnished with a  horn tusk, of which the force of penetration is extreme.    Hum !  said the harpooner, shaking his head like a  man who will not let himself be convinced.    Remember, my worthy Canadian, I continued,  if  such an animal exists and inhabits the depths of the ocean,  it necessarily possesses an organisation the strength of  which would defy all comparison.    Why must it have such an organisation ?  asked Ned.    Because it requires an incalculable strength to keep in  such deep water and resist its pressure. Admitting that  the pressure of the atmosphere is represented by that of a  column of water thirty-two feet high. In reality the  column of water would not be so high, as it is sea-water  that is in question, and its density is greater than that of  fresh water. When you dive, Ned, as many times thirty-     UNDER THE SEA 23   two feet of water as there are above you, so many times  does your body support a pressure equal to that of the j  atmosphere that is to say, islbs. for each square inch of  its surface. It hence follows that at 320 feet this pressure  equals that of 10 atmospheres ; at 3,200 feet, 100 atmos-  pheres ; and at 32,000 feet, 1,000 atmospheres that is,  about six and a half miles, which is equivalent to saying  that if you can reach this depth in the ocean, each square  inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of  14,933 Ibs. Do you know how many square inches you  have on the surface of your body ?     I have no idea, Aronnax.    About 6,500 ; and as in reality the atmospheric pres-  sure is about 15 Ibs. to the square inch your 6,500 square  inches support at this minute a pressure of 97,500 Ibs.    Without my perceiving it ?     Yes ; and if you are not crushed by such a pressure,  it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body  with equal pressure, and there is a perfect equilibrium be-  tween the interior and exterior pressure, which thus neutra-  lise each other, and allow you to bear it without inconveni-  ence. But it is another thing in water.    Yes, I understand, answered Ned, becoming more  attentive,  because I am in water, but it is not in me.    Precisely, Ned ; so that at 32 feet below the surface of  the sea you would undergo a pressure of 97,500 Ibs ; at  320 feet, 975,000 Ibs. ; and at 32,000 feet the pressure  would be 97,500,000 Ibs. that is to say, you would be  crushed as flat as a pancake.    The devil !  exclaimed Ned.    If vertebrata can maintain themselves in such depths,  especially those whose surface is represented by millions of  square inches, it is by hundreds of millions of pounds we  must estimate the pressure they bear. Calculate, then,  what must be the resistance of their bony structure and the  strength of their organisation to withstand such a pres-  sure.    They must be made of iron plate eight inches thick  like the ironclads !  said Ned.    Yes, and think what destruction such a mass could     24 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   cause if hurled with the speed of an express against the hull  of a ship.   Ned would not give in.    Have I not convinced you ?  I asked.    You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is, that  if such animals do exist at the bottom of the sea they must  be as strong as you say.    But if they do not exist, Mr. Obstinate, how do you  account for the Scotia's accident ?     Because it is not true !  answered the Canadian.   But this answer proved the obstinacy of the harpooner  and nothing else. That day I did not press him further.  The accident to the Scotia was undeniable. Now the hole  had not made itself, and since it had not been done by sub-  marine rocks, it was certainly due to the perforating tool of  an animal.   CHAPTER V   AT RANDOM   THE voyage of the Abrahan Lincoln for some time was  marked by no incident. At last a circumstance arose to  show the wonderful skill of Ned Land and the confidence  that might be placed in him.   On the 3oth of June the frigate, being then off the Falk-  land Islands, spoke some American whalers, who told us  they had not met with the narwhal. But one of them, the  captain of the Munroe, knowing that Ned Land was on  board the Abraham Lincoln, asked for his help in captur-  ing a whale they had in sight. Captain Farragut, desirous  of seeing Ned Land at work, allowed him to go on board  the Munroe, and fortune favoured our Canadian so well, that  instead of one whale he harpooned two with a double blow,  striking one right in the heart, and capturing the other after  a pursuit of some minutes.   The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with  extraordinary rapidity. On the 3rd of July we were at the  opening of the Straits of Magellan, off Cape Vierges. But  Captain Farragut did not wish to take this sinuous passage,  but worked the ship for the doubling of Cape Horn.   On the 6th of July, about 3 p.m., we doubled, fifteen     UNDER THE SEA 25   miles to the south, the solitary island to which some Dutch  sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn.  The next day the frigate was in the Pacific.    Keep a sharp look-out !  cried all the sailors.   Both eyes and telescopes, a little dazzled certainly by the  thought of 2,000 dollars, never had a minute's rest. Day  and night they observed the surface of the ocean.   I myself, who thought little about the money, was not,  however, the least attentive on board. I was constantly on  deck, giving but few minutes to my meals, and indifferent  to either rain or sunshine. Now leaning over the sea on  the forecastle, now on the taffrail, I devoured with greedy  eyes the soft foam which whitened the sea as far as those  eyes could reach ! How many times have I shared the  emotion of the officers and crew when some capricious  whale raised its black back above the waves ! The deck  was crowded in a minute. The companion ladders poured  forth a torrent of officers and sailors, each with heaving  breast and troubled eye watching the cetacean. I looked  and looked till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil, always  calm, kept saying to me    If monsieur did not keep his eyes open so much he  would see more.   But vain excitement ! The Abraham Lincoln would  modify her speed, run down the animal signalled, which al-  ways turned out to be a simple whale or common cachalot,  and disappeared amidst a storm of execration.   In the meantime the weather remained favourable. The  voyage was being accomplished under the best conditions.  It was then the bad season in the southern hemisphere, for  the July of that zone corresponds with the January of  Europe, yet the sea was so calm that the eye could scan a  vast circumference.   Ned Land always showed the most tenacious incredulity ;  he even affected not to examine the seas except during his  watch, unless a whale was in sight ; and yet his marvellous  power of vision might have been of great service. But eight  hours out of the twelve the obstinate Canadian read or slept  in his cabin.    Bah !  he would answer ;  there is nothing, M.     26 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Aronnax ; and even if there is an animal, what chance have  we of seeing it ? Are we not going about at random ? I  will admit that the beast has been seen again in the North  Pacific, but two months have already gone by since that  meeting, and according to the temperament of your nar-  whal it does not like to stop long enough in the same quarter  to grow mouldy. Therefore, if the beast exists, it is far  enough off now.   I did not know what to answer to that. We were evi-  dently going along blindly. But how were we to do other-  wise ? Our chances, too, were very limited. In the  meantime no one yet doubted our eventual success.   On the 20th of July the tropic of Capricorn was crossed at  105 longitude, and the 2jth of the same month we crossed  the equator on the noth meridian. These bearings taken,  the frigate took a more decided direction westward, and  entered the central seas of the Pacific. Commander Farra-  gut rightly thought that it was better to frequent the deep  seas, and keep at a distance from continents or islands.which  the animal had always seemed to avoid approaching.   We were at last on the scene of the last frolics of the  monster ; and the entire crew were under the influence of  indescribable nervous excitement. They neither ate nor  slept. Twenty times a day some error of estimation, or  the optical delusion of a sailor perched on the yards, caused  intolerable frights ; and these emotions, twenty times  repeated, kept us in a state of tension as to cause an early  reaction.   And, in fact, the reaction was not slow in coming. For  three months three months, each day of which lasted a  century the Abraham Lincoln ploughed all the waters of  the North Pacific, running down all the whales signalled,  making sharp deviations from her route, veering suddenly  from one tack to another, and not leaving one point of the  Chinese or Japanese coast unexplored. And yet nothing  was seen but the immense waste of waters nothing that  resembled a gigantic narwhal, nor a submarine islet, nor a  wreck, nor a floating reef, nor anything at all supernatural.   The reaction, therefore, began. Discouragement at  first took possession of all minds, and opened a breach for     UNDER THE SEA 27   incredulity. A new sentiment was experienced on board,  composed of three-tenths of shame and seven-tenths of  rage. They called themselves fools for being taken in by a  chimera, and were still more furious at it. The mountains  of arguments piled up for a year suddenly collapsed, and the  determination of the crew was to compensate for the hours  foolishly wasted in eating and sleeping.   With the mobility natural to the human mind they  threw themselves from one excess into another. The  warmest partisans of the enterprise became finally its most  ardent detractors. The reaction ascended from the depths  of the vessel, from the coal-hole, to the officers' ward-room,  and certainly, had it not been for very strong determination  on the part of Captain Farragut, the head of the frigate  would have been definitely turned southward.   However, this useless search could be no further pro-  longed. The Abraham Lincoln had nothing to reproach  herself with, having done all she could to succeed. There  was nothing left to do but to return.   A representation in this sense was made to the com-  mander. The commander kept his ground. The sailors  did not hide their dissatisfaction, and the service suffered  from it. I do not mean that there was revolt on board,  but after a reasonable period of obstinacy the commander,  Farragut, like Columbus before him, asked for three days'  patience. If in the delay of three days the monster had not  reappeared, the man at the helm should give three turns of  the wheel and the Abraham Lincoln should make for the  European seas.   This promise was made on the 2nd of November. Its  first effect was to rally the spirits of the ship's company.  The ocean was observed with renewed attention.   Two days passed. The frigate kept up steam at half-  pressure. Large quantities of bacon were trailed in the  wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction of the sharks.  The frigate lay to, and her boats were sent in all directions,  but the night of the 4th of November passed without un-  veiling the submarine mystery.   The next day, the 5th of November, was the last of the  delay.     28 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   The frigate was then in 31 15' N. latitude and 136  42' E. longitude. Japan lay less than 200 miles to lee-  ward. Eight bells had just struck as I was leaning over  the starboard side. Conseil, standing near me, was look-  ing straight in front of him. The crew, perched in the rat-  lins, were keeping a sharp look-out in the approaching  darkness. Officers with their night-glasses swept the horizon.   Looking at Conseil, I saw that the brave fellow was feeling  slightly the general influence at least it seemed to me so.  Perhaps for the first time his nerves were vibrating under  the action of a sentiment of curiosity.    Well, Conseil, said I,  this is your last chance of pocket-  ing 2,000 dollars.    Will monsieur allow me to tell him that I never counted  upon the reward, and if the Union had promised a hundred  thousand dollars it would never be any the poorer.    You are right, Conseil. It has been a stupid affair, after  all. We have lost time and patience, and might just as  well have been in France six months ago.    Yes, in monsieur's little apartments, classifying mon-  sieur's treasures.    Yes, Conseil, and besides that we shall get well laughed  at.    Certainly, said Conseil tranquilly.  I think they  will laugh at monsieur. And I must say     What, Conseil ?     That it will serve monsieur right ! When one has the  honour to be a savant like monsieur, one does not ex-   Conseil did not finish his compliment. In the midst of  general silence Ned Land's voice was heard calling out    Look out there ! The thing we are looking for on our  weather beam 1    CHAPTER VI   WITH ALL STEAM ON   AT this cry the entire crew rushed towards the harpooner.  Captain, officers, masters, sailors, and cabin-boys, even  the engineers left their engines, and the stokers their fires.  The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate was     UNDER THE SEA 29   only moving by her own momentum. The darkness was  then profound, and although I knew the Canadian's eyes  were very good, I asked myself what he could have seen  and how he could have seen it. My heart beat violently.   But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all saw the  object he was pointing to.   At two cables' length from the Abraham Lincoln on her  starboard quarter the sea seemed to be illuminated below  the surface. The monster lay some fathoms below the  sea, and threw out the very intense but inexplicable light  mentioned in the reports of several captains.   It is only an agglomeration of phosphoric particles,  cried one of the officers.    No, sir, I replied with conviction.  That light is  essentially electric. Besides see ! look out ! It moves  forward on to us !    A general cry rose from the frigate.    Silence 1  called out the captain.  Up with the  helm 1 Reverse the engines !    The frigate thus tried to escape, but the supernatural  animal approached her with a speed double her own.   Stupefaction, more than fear, kept us mute and motion-  less. The animal gained upon us. It made the round of  the frigate, which was then going at the rate of fourteen  knots, and enveloped her with its electric ring like lumin-  ous dust. Then it went two or three miles off, leaving a  phosphoric trail like the steam of an express locomotive.  All at once, the monster rushed towards the frigate with  frightful rapidity, stopped suddenly at a distance of twenty  feet, and then went out, not diving, for its brilliancy did  not die out by degrees, but all at once as if turned off.  Then it reappeared on the other side of the ship, either  going round her or gliding under her hull. A collision  might have occurred at any moment, which might have  been fatal to us.   I was astonished at the way the ship was worked. She  was being attacked instead of attacking ; and I asked Cap-  tain Farragut the reason. On the captain's generally  impassive face was an expression of profound astonishment.   M. Aronnax, he said,  I do not know with how for-     30 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   midable a being I have to deal, and I will not imprudently  risk my frigate in the darkness. We must wait for daylight,  and then we shall change our tactics.    You have no longer any doubt, captain, of the nature  of the animal ?     No, sir. It is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an  electric one too.    Perhaps, I added,  we can no more approach it than  we could a torpedo.    It may possess as great blasting properties, and if it  does it is the most terrible animal that ever was created.  That is why I must keep on my guard.   All the crew remained up that night. No one thought  of going to sleep. The Abraham Lincoln, not being able  to compete in speed, was kept under half-steam. On its  side the narwhal imitated the frigate, let the waves rock it  at will, and seemed determined not to leave the scene of  combat.   Towards midnight, however, it disappeared, dying out  like a large glowworm. At seven minutes to one in the  morning a deafening whistle was heard, like that produced  by a column of water driven out with extreme violence.   The captain, Ned Land, and I were then on the poop,  peering with eagerness through the profound darkness.    Ned Land, asked the commander, have you often  heard whales roar ?     Yes, captain, often ; but never such a whale as I earned  two thousand dollars by sighting.    True, you have a right to the prize ; but tell me, is it  the same noise they make ?     Yes, sir ; but this one is incomparably louder. It is  not to be mistaken. It is certainly a cetacean. With  your permission, sir, we will have a few words with him at  daybreak.    If he is in a humour to hear them, Mr. Land, said I,  in an unconvinced tone.    Let me get within a length of four harpoons, ans-  wered the Canadian,  and he will be obliged to listen to me.    But in order to approach him, continued the captain,  '' I shall have to put a whaler at your service.     UNDER THE SEA 31    Certainly, sir.    But that will be risking the lives of my men.    And mine too, answered the harpooner simply.   About 2 a.m. the luminous focus reappeared, no less in-  tense, about five miles to the windward of the frigate. Not-  withstanding the distance and the noise of the wind and sea,  the loud strokes of the animal's tail were distinctly heard,  and even its breathing. When the enormous narwhal came  up to the surface to breathe, it seemed as if the air rushed  into its lungs like steam in the vast cylinders of a 2,000  horse power engine.   With daylight the fishing-tackle was prepared. The first  mate loaded the blunderbusses, which throw harpoons the  distance of a mile, and long duck-guns with explosive bullets  which inflict mortal wounds even upon the most powerful  animals. Ned Land contented himself with sharpening his  harpoon a terrible weapon in his hands.   At 6 a.m. day began to break, and with the first glimmer  of dawn the electric light of the narwhal disappeared. At  7 a.m. a very thick sea-fog obscured the atmosphere, and the  best glasses could not pierce it.   I climbed the mizenmast and found some officers already  perched on the mast-heads.   At 8 a.m. the mist began to clear away. Suddenly, like  the night before, Ned Land's voice was heard calling    It's on the port quarter !    All eyes were turned towards the point indicated. There,  A mile and a half from the frigate a large black body emerged  more than a yard above the waves. Its tail, violently  agitated, produced a considerable eddy. An immense  track, dazzlingly white, marked the passage of the animal,  ind described a long curve.   The frigate approached the cetacean, and I could see it  well. The accounts of it given by the Shannon and Hel-  vetia had rather exaggerated its dimensions, and I estimated  its length at 150 feet only. As to its other dimensions, I  could only conceive them to be in proportion.   Whilst I was observing it, two jets of vapour and water  sprang from its vent-holes and ascended to a height of fifty  yards, thus fixing my opinion as to its way of breathing.     32 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   I concluded definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate  branch of mammalia, order of cetaceans, family. . . .  Here I could not decide. The order of cetaceans compre-  hends three families whales, cachalots, and dolphins  and it is in this last that narwhals are placed.   The crew were waiting impatiently for their captain's  orders. Farragut, after attentively examining the animal,  had the chief engineer called.    Is your steam up, sir ?  asked the captain.    Yes, captain, answered the engineer.    Then make up your fires and put on all steam.   Three cheers greeted this order. The hour of combat  had arrived. Some minutes afterwards the funnels of the  frigate were giving out torrents of black smoke, and the  deck shook under the trembling of the boilers.   The Abraham Lincoln, propelled by her powerful screw,  went straight at the animal, who let her approach to within  half a cable's length, and then, as if disdaining to dive,  moved on, contenting itself with keeping its distance.   This pursuit lasted about three-quarters of an hour, with-  out the frigate gaining four yards on the cetacean. It was  quite evident she would never reach it at that rate.   The captain twisted his beard impatiently.    Ned Land !  called the captain,  do you think I had  better have the boats lowered ?     No, sir, answered Ned Land,  for that animal won't  be caught unless it chooses.    What must be done, then ?     Force steam if you can, captain, and I, \\ith your per-  mission, will post myself under the bowsprit, and if we get  within a harpoon length I shall hurl one.    Very well, Ned, said the captain.  Engineer, put on  more pressure.   Ned Land went to his post, the fires were increased, the  screw revolved forty-three times a minute, and the steam  poured out of the valves. The log was heaved, and it was  found that the frigate was going eighteen miles and five-  tenths an hour. But the animal went eighteen and five-  tenths an hour too.   During another hour the frigate kept up that speed with-     UNDER THE SEA 33   out gaining a yard. The crew began to get very angry.  The captain not only twisted his beard, he began to gnaw it  too. The engineer was called once more.    Have you reached your maximum of pressure ?   asked the captain.    Yes, sir.   The captain ordered him to do all he could without  absolutely blowing up the vessel, and coal was at once piled  up on the fires. The speed of the frigate increased. Her  masts shook again. The log was again heaved, and this  time she was making nineteen miles and three-tenths.    All steam on !  called out the captain.   The engineer obeyed. But the cetacean did the nineteen  miles and three-tenths as easily as the eighteen and  five-tenths.   What a chase ! I cannot describe the emotion that  made my whole being vibrate again. Ned Land kept at  his post, harpoon in hand. The animal allowed itself to  be approached several times. Sometimes it was so near  that the Canadian raised his hand to hurl the harpoon,  when the animal rushed away at a speed of at least thirty  miles an hour, and even during our maximum of speed it  treated the frigate indifferently, going round and round it.   A cry of fury burst from all lips. We were not further  advanced at twelve o'clock than we had been at eight.  Captain Farragut then made up his mind to employ more  direct means.    Ah !  said he,  so that animal goes faster than my  ship. Well, we'll see if he'll go faster than a bullet. Master,  send your men to the forecastle.   The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and pointed.  It was fired.but the ball passed some feet above the cetacean  which kept about half a mile off.    Let some one else have a try !  called out the captain.  ' Five hundred dollars to the marksman who hits the beast.   An old gunner with a grey beard I think I see now his  calm face as he approached the gun put it into position and  took a long aim. A loud report followed and mingled with  the cheers of the crew.   The bullet reached its destination ; it struck the animal,     34 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   but, gliding off the rounded surface, fell into the sea two  miles off.    Malediction !  cried the captain ;  that animal must  be clad in six-inch iron plates. But I'll catch it, if I have to  blow up my frigate !    It was to be hoped that the animal would be exhausted,  and that it would not be indifferent to fatigue like a steam-  engine. But the hours went on, and it showed no signs  of exhaustion.   It must be said, in praise of the Abraham Lincoln, that  she struggled on indefatigably. I cannot reckon the dis-  tance we made during this memorable day at less than 300  miles. But night came on and closed round the heaving ocean.   At that minute I believed our expedition to be at an  end, and that we should see the fantastic animal no more.   I was mistaken, for at 10.50 p.m. the electric light re-  appeared, three miles windward to the frigate, as clear and  intense as on the night before.   The narwhal seemed motionless. Perhaps, fatigued  with its day's work, it was sleeping in its billowy cradle.  That was a chance by which the captain resolved to profit.   He gave his orders. The Abraham Lincoln was kept up  at half-steam, and advanced cautiously so as not to awaken  hex adversary. It is not rare to meet in open sea with  whales fast asleep, and Ned Land had harpooned many a  one in that condition. The Canadian went back to his  post under the bowsprit.   The frigate noiselessly approached, and stopped at two  cables' length from the animal. Nojone breathed. A pro-  found silence reigned on deck. We were not 1,000 feet  from the burning focus, the light of which increased and  dazzled our eyes.   At that minute, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw  Ned Land below me, holding the martingale with one hand  and with the other brandishing his terrible harpoon, scarcely  twenty feet from the motionless animal.   All at once he threw the harpoon, and I heard the sonorous  stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard  body.   The electric light suddenly went out, and two enormous     UNDER THE SEA 35   water-spouts fell on the deck of the frigate, running like a  torrent from fore to aft, upsetting men and breaking the  lashing of the spars.   A frightful shock followed. I was thrown over the rail  before I had time to stop myself, and fell into the sea.   CHAPTER VII   A WHALE OF AN UNKNOWN SPECIES   ALTHOUGH I was surprised by my unexpected fall, I still  kept a very distinct impression of my sensations. I was at  first dragged down to a depth of about twenty feet. I  was a good swimmer without any pretensions to equal  Byron or Edgar Poe, both masters in the art, and this  plunge did not make me lose my presence of mind. Two  vigorous kicks brought me back to the surface.   My first care was to look for the frigate. Had the crew  seen me disappear ?   The darkness was profound. I perceived a black mass  disappearing in the east, the beacon lights of which were  dying out in the distance. It was the frigate. I gave my-  self up.    Help ! help !  cried I, swimming towards the frigate  with desperate strokes.   My clothes embarrassed me. The water glued them to  my body. They paralysed my movements. I was sinking.    Help !  rang out again in the darkness.   This was the last cry I uttered. My mouth filled with  water. I struggled to prevent being sucked into the abyss.   Suddenly my clothes were seized by a vigorous hand, and  I felt myself brought back violently to the surface of the  water, and I heard yes, I heard these words uttered in my  ear :    If monsieur will have the goodness to lean on my  shoulder, monsieur will swim much better.   I seized the arm of my faithful Conseil.    You !  I cried you !     Myself, answered Conseil,  at monsieur's service.    Did the shock throw you into the sea too ?     No ; but being in the service of monsieur, I followed  him.   c     36 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   The worthy fellow thought that quite natural.    What about the frigate ?  I asked.    The frigate !  answered Conseil, turning on his back ;  ' I think monsieur will do well not to count upon the fri-  gate.    Why ?     Because, as I jumped into the sea, I heard the man at  the helm call out, ' The screw and the rudder are broken. ' '    Broken ?  ,    Yes, by the monster's tusk. It is the only damage she  has sustained, I think ; but without a helm she can't do  anything for us.    Then we are lost.    Perhaps, answered Conseil tranquilly.  In the  meantime we have still several hours before us, and in  several hours many things may happen.   The imperturbable sang-froid of Conseil did me good. I  swam more vigorously, but, encumbered by my garments,  which dragged me down like a leaden weight, I found it ex-  tremely difficult to keep up. Conseil perceived it.    Will monsieur allow me to make a slit ?  said he. And,  slipping an open knife under my clothes, he slit them rapidly  from top to bottom. Then he quickly helped me off with  them whilst I swam for both. I rendered him the same ser-  vice, and we went on swimming near each other.   In the meantime our situation was none the less terrible.  Perhaps our disappearance had not been noticed, and even  if it had the frigate could not tack without her helm. Our  only chance of safety was in the event of the boats being  lowered.   The collision had happened about n p.m. About i a.m.  I was taken with extreme fatigue, and all my limbs be-  came stiff with cramp. Conseil was obliged to keep me up,  and my life depended upon him alone. I heard the poor  fellow breathing hard, and knew he could not keep up much  longer.    Let me go ! Leave me !  I cried.    Leave monsieur ? Never !  he answered.  I shall  drown with him.   Just then the moon appeared through the fringe of a large     UNDER THE SEA 37   cloud'that the wind was driving eastward. The surface of the  sea shone under her rays. I lifted my head and saw the  frigate. She was five miles from us, and only looked like a  dark mass, scarcely distinguishable. I saw no boats.   I tried to call out, but it was useless at that distance.  My swollen lips would not utter a sound. Conseil could  still speak, and I heard him call out  Help !  several times.   We halted for an instant and listened. It might be only  a singing in our ears, but it seemed to me that a cry an-  swered Conseil's.    Did you hear ?  I murmured.    Yes, yes !    And Conseil threw another despairing cry into space.  This time there could be no mistake. A voice answered ours.  Was it the voice of some other victim of the shock, or a  boat hailing us in the darkness ? Conseil made a supreme  effort, and, leaning on my shoulder whilst I made a last  struggle for us both, he raised himself half out of the water,  and I heard him shout. Then my strength was exhausted,  my mouth filled with water, I went cold all over, and began  to sink.   At that moment I hit against something hard, and I clung  to it in desperation. Then I felt myself lifted out of the  water, and I fainted I soon came to, thanks to the vigor-  ous friction that was being applied to my body, and I half  opened my eyes.    Conseil !  I murmured.    Did monsieur ring ?  answered Conseil.   Just then, by the light of the moon that was getting  lower on the horizon, I perceived a face that u was not Con-  seil's, but which I immediately recognised.    Ned !  I cried.    The same, sir, looking after his prize, replied the  Canadian.    Were you thrown into the sea when the frigate was  struck ?     Yes, sir, but, luckier than you, I soon got upon a float-  ing island.    An island ?     Yes, or if you like better, on our giant narwhal.     38 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    What do you mean, Ned ?     I mean that I understand now why my. harpoon did  not stick into the skin, but was blunted.    Why, Ned, why ?     Because the beast is made of sheet-iron plates.   I wriggled myself quickly to the top of the half-submerged  being or object on which we had found refuge. I struck  my foot against it. It was evidently a hard and impene-  trable body, and not the soft substance which forms the  mass of great marine mammalia. But this hard body could  not be a bony substance like that of antediluvian animals. I  could not even class it amongst amphibious reptiles, such as  tortoises and alligators, for the blackish back that sup-  ported me was not scaly but smooth and polished.   The blow produced a metallic sound, and, strange as it  may appear, seemed caused by being struck on riveted plates.  Doubt was no longer possible. The phenomenon that had  puzzled the scientific world, and misled the imagination of  sailors in the two hemspheres, was, it must be acknow-  edged, a still more astonishing phenomenon, a phenomenon  of man's making. It seems quite simple that anything  prodigious should come from the hand of the Creator, but to  find the impossible realised by the hand of man was enough  to confound the imagination.   We were lying uponthe top of a sort of submarine boat,  which looked to me like an immense steel fish. Ned Land's  mind was made up on that point, and Conseil and I could  only agree with him.    But then, said I,  this apparatus must have a loco-  motive machine, and a crew inside of it to work it.   Evidently, replied the harpooner, and yet for the three  hours that I have inhabited this floating island it has not  given sign of life.    The vessel has not moved ?     No, M. Aronnax. It is cradled in the waves, but it  does not move.    We know, without the slighest doubt, however, that it  is endowed with great speed, and as a machine is necessary  to produce the speed, and a mechanician to guide it, I con-  clude from that that we are saved.     UNDER THE SEA 39    Hum, said Ned Land in a reserved tone of voice.   At that moment, and as if to support my arguments, a  boiling was heard at the back of the strange apparatus,  the propeller of which was evidently a screw, and it began  to move. We only had time to hold on to its upper part,  which emerged about a yard out of the water. Happily its  speed was not excessive.    As long as it moves horizontally, murmured Ned  Land,  I have nothing to say. But if it takes into its  head to plunge I would not give two dollars for my skin !    The Canadian might have said less still. It therefore  became urgent to communicate with whatever beings were  shut up in the machine. I looked on its surface for an  opening, a panel, a  man-hole, to use the technical ex-  pression ; but the lines of bolts, solidly fastened down on  the joints of the plates, were clear and uniform.   Besides, the moon then disappeared and left us in pro-  found obscurity. We were obliged to wait till daybreak  to decide upon the means of penetrating to the interior of  this submarine boat.   Thus, then, our safety depended solely upon the caprice  of the mysterious steersmen who directed this apparatus,  and if they plunged we were lost ! Unless that happened I  did not doubt the possibility of entering into communica-  tion with them. And it was certain that unless they made  their own air they must necessarily return from time to  time to the surface of the ocean. Therefore there must be  an opening which put the interior of the boat into com-  munication with the atmosphere.   As to the hope of being saved by Commander Farragut,  that had to be abandoned. We were dragged westward,  and I estimated that our speed attained twelve miles an  hour. The screw beat the waves with mathematical  regularity, sometimes emerging and throwing the phos-  phorescent water to a great height.   About 4 a.m. the rapidity of the apparatus increased.  We resisted with difficulty this whirling impulsion, when the  waves beat upon us in all their fury. Happily Ned touched  with his hand a wide balustrade fastened on to the upper  part of the iron top, and we succeeded in holding on to it.     40 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   At last this long night slipped away. My incomplete  memory does not allow me to retrace all the impressions  of it. A single detail returns to my mind. During certain  hillings of the sea and wind, I thought several times I  heard vague sounds, a sort of fugitive harmony produced  by far-off chords. What, then, was the mystery of this  submarine navigation, of which the entire world vainly  sought the explanation ? What beings lived in this strange  boat ?   When daylight appeared the morning mists enveloped us,  but they soon rose, and I proceeded to make an examination  of the sort of horizontal platform we were on, when I felt  myself gradually sinking.    A thousand devils !  cried Land, kicking against the  metal,  open, inhospitable creatures !    But it was difficult to make oneself heard amidst the  deafening noise made by the screw. Happily the sinking  ceased.   Suddenly a noise like iron bolts violently withdrawn was  heard from the interior of the boat. One of the iron plates  was raised, a man appeared, uttered a strange cry, and  disappeared immediately.   Some moments after eight strong fellows, with veiled  faces, silently appeared, and dragged us down into their  formidable machine.   CHAPTER VIII   TWO STRANGERS   THIS abduction, so brutally executed, took place with  the rapidity of lightning. I do not know what my com-  panions felt at being introduced into this floating prison ;  but, for my own part, a rapid shudder froze my veins.  With whom had we to do ? Doubtless with a new species  of pirates, who made use of the sea in a way of their own.  The narrow panel had scarcely closed upon me when I  was enveloped by profound darkness. My eyes, dazzled  by the light outside, could distinguish nothing. I felt  my naked feet touch the steps of an iron ladder. Ned  Land and Conseil, firmly held, followed me. At the bottom     UNDER THE SEA 41   of the ladder a door opened and closed again immediately  with a bang.   We were alone. Where ? I neither knew nor could I  imagine. All was absolute darkness.   Meanwhile, Ned Land, furious at this manner of pro-  ceeding, gave free course to his indignation.    The people here equal the Scotch in hospitality !  he  cried.  They could not be worse if they were cannibals.  I shouldn't be surprised if they were, but I declare they  shan't eat me without my protesting !     Calm yourself, friend Ned ; calm yourself, answered  Conseil tranquilly.  Don't get into a rage beforehand. We  aren't on the spit yet.    No, but we're in the oven. This hole's as dark as one.  Happily my bowie-knife is still on me, and the first rascal  that lays his hand on me     Don't get irritated, Ned, then said I to the harpooner,   and do not compromise yourself by useless violence.  Who knows that we are not overheard ? Let us rather try  to make out where we are.   I groped my way about. When I had gone about five  steps I came to an iron wall made of riveted plates. Then  turning, I knocked against a wooden table, near which  were several stools. The flooring of this prison was hidden  under thick flax-like matting, which deadened the noise  of our footsteps. The walls revealed no traces of either  door or window. Conseil, going round the reverse way,  met me, and we returned to the centre of the room, which  measured about twenty feet by ten. As to its height, Ned  Land, notwithstanding his tall stature, could not measure it.   Half an hour passed away without bringing any change  in our position, when from the extreme of obscurity our eyes  passed suddenly to the most violent light. Our prison was  lighted up all at once that is to say, it was filled with a  luminous matter so intense that at first I could not bear its  brilliancy. I saw from its whiteness and intensity that it  was the same electric light that shone around the submarine  boat like a magnificent phosphoric phenomenon. After  having voluntarily closed my eyes I opened them again, and  saw that the luminous agent was escaping from a polished     42 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   half-globe, which was shining in the top part of the room   Well, we can see at last ! cried Ned Land, who, with  his knife in hand, kept himself on the defensive.    Yes, answered I,  but the situation is none the less  obscure.    Let monsieur have patience, said the impassible Conseil,  The light had allowed me to examine the cabin in detail.  It only contained the table and five stools. The invisible  door seemed hermetically closed. No noise reached our  ears. All seemed dead in the interior of this machine.  Was it moving, or was it motionless on the surface of the  ocean, or deep in its depths ? I could not guess.   However, the luminous globe was not lighted without a  reason. A noise of bolts and bars being withdrawn was  heard, the door opened, and two men appeared. One was  short in stature, muscular, with broad shoulders, large head.,  abundant black hair, thick moustache, and all his person  imprinted with that vivacity which characterises the in-  habitants of southern France.   The second deserves a more detailed description. I  read at once his dominant qualities on his open face self-  confidence, because his head was firmly set on his shoulders,  and his black eyes looked round with cold assurance  calmness, for his pale complexion announced the tran-  quillity of his blood energy, demonstrated by the rapid  contraction of his eyebrows ; and lastly, courage, for his  deep breathing denoted vast vital expansion. I felt in-  voluntarily reassured in his presence, and augured good  from it. He might be of any age from thirty-five to fifty.  His tall stature, wide forehead, straight nose, clear-cut  mouth, magnificent teeth, taper hands, indicated a highly-  nervous temperament. This man formed certainly the most  admirable type I had ever met. One strange detail was  that his eyes, rather far from each other, could take in  nearly a quarter of the horizon at once. This faculty I  verified it later on was added to a power of vision superior  even to that of Ned Land. When the unknown fixed an  object he frowned, and his large eyelids closed round so as  to contract the range of his vision, and the result was a look  that penetrated your very soul     UNDER THE SEA 43   The two strangers had on caps made from the fur of the  sea-otter, sealskin, boots, and clothes of a peculiar texture,  which allowed them great liberty of movement.   The taller of the two evidently the chief on board ex-  amined us without speaking a word. Then he turned to-  wards his companion, and spoke to him in a language I  could not understand. It was a sonorous, harmonious, and  flexible idiom, of which the vowels seemed very variously  accented.   The other answered by shaking his head and uttering  two or three incomprehensible words. Then, from his looks,  he seemed to be questioning me directly.   I answered in good French that I did not understand his  language ; but he did not seem to know French, and the  situation became very embarrassing.    If monsieur would relate his story, said Conseil,   these gentlemen may understand some words of it.   I began the recital of my adventures, articulating clearly  all my syllables, without leaving out a single detail. I  gave our names and occupations. The man with the soft,  calm eyes listened to me with remarkable attention. But  nothing in his face indicated that he understood me. When  I had done he did not speak a word.   There still remained one resource that of speaking  English. Perhaps they would understand that almost  universal language. I knew it, and German too, sufficiently  to read it correctly, but not to speak it fluently.    It is your turn now, Land, I said to the harpooner.   Make use of your best English, and try to be more for-  tunate than I.   Ned did not need urging, and began the same tale in  English, and ended by saying what was perfectly true,  that we were half-dead with hunger. To his great disgust,  the harpooner did not seem more intelligible than I. Our  visitors did not move a feature. It was evident that they  neither knew the language of Arago nor Faraday. I was  wondering what to do next, when Conseil said to me    If monsieur will allow me, I will tell them in German.'    What ! do you know German ?  I cried.    Like a Dutchman, sir.     44 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Well, do your best, old fellow.   And Conseil, in his tranquil voice, told our story for the  third time, but without success.   I then assembled all the Latin I had learnt at school,  and told my adventures in that dead language. Cicero  would have stopped his ears and sent me to the kitchen,  but I did the best I could with the same negative result.   After this last attempt the strangers exchanged a few  words in their incomprehensible language, and went away  without a gesture that could reassure us. The door closed,  upon them.    It is infamous !  cried Ned Land, who broke out again  for the twentieth time. jWhat ! French, English, German,  and Latin are spoken to those rascals, and not one  of them has the politeness to answer.    Calm yourself, Ned, said I to the enraged harpooner ;   anger will do no good.    But do you know, professor, continued our irascible  companion,  that it is quite possible to die of hunger in this  iron cage ?     Bah !  exclaimed Conseil ;  with exercising a little  philosophy we can still hold out a long while.    My friends, said I,  we must not despair. We have  been in worse situations before now. Do me the pleasure of  waiting before you form an opinion of the commander and  crew of this vessel.    My opinion is already formed, answered Ned Land.   They are rascals     Well, and of what country ?     Of Rascaldom !     My worthy Ned, that country is not yet sufficiently  indicated on the map of the world, and I acknowledge that  the nationality of those two men is difficult to determine.  Neither English, French, nor German, that is all we can  affirm. However, I should be tempted to admit that the  commander and his second were born under low latitudes.  There is something meridional in them.    That is the disadvantage of not knowing every lan-  guage, answered Conseil,  or the disadvantage of not  having a single language.     UNDER THE SEA 45    That would be of no use, answered Ned Land.  Do  you not see that those fellows have a language of their own  a language invented to make honest men who want their  dinners despair ? But in every country in the world, to  open your mouth, move,your jaws, snap your teeth and lips,  is understood. Does it not mean in Quebec as well as the  Society Islands, in Paris as well as the antipodes, I am  hungry give me something to eat ?     Oh, said Conseil,  there are people so unintelligent   As he was saying these words the door opened, and a  steward entered. He brought us clothes similar to those  worn by the two strangers, which we hastened to don.   Meanwhile the servant without saying a word had laid  the cloth for three.    This is something like, said Conseil,  and promises  well.    I'll bet anything there's nothing here fit to eat, said  the harpooner.  Tortoise liver, fillets of shark, or beef-  steak from a sea-dog, perhaps !     We shall soon see, said Conseil.   The dishes with their silver covers were symmetrically  placed on the table. We had certainly civilised people  to deal with, and had it not been for the electric light which  inundated us I might have imagined myself in the Adelphi  Hotel in Liverpool or the Grand Hotel in Paris. There was  neither bread nor wine, nothing but pure fresh water, which  was not at all to Ned Land's taste. Amongst the dishes  that were placed before us I recognised several kinds of fish  delicately cooked ; but there were some that I knew nothing  about, though they were delicious. I could not tell to what  kingdom their contents belonged. The dinner service was  elegant and in perfect taste ; each piece was engraved with  a letter and motto of which the following is a fac-simile :  Mobilis in Mobile.  N.   Mobile in a mobile element ! The letter N was doubtless  the initial of the enigmatical person who commanded  at the bottom of the sea.   Ned and Conseil did not observe so much. They de-     46 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   voured all before them, and I ended by imitating them.   But at last even our appetite was satisfied, and we felt  overcome with sleep. A natural reaction after the fatigue  of the interminable night during which we had struggled  with death.   My two companions lay down on the carpet, and were  soon fast asleep. I did not go so soon, for too many thoughts  filled my brain ; too many insoluble questions asked me for  a solution ; too many images kept my eyes open. I felt, or  rather I thought I felt, the strange machine sinking down  to the lowest depths of the sea. Dreadful nightmares took  possession of me. Then my brain grew calmer, my imagi-  nation melted into dreaminess, and I fell into a deep sleep.     CHAPTER IX  NED LAND'S ANGER   I DO not know how long our sleep lasted, but it must have  been a long time, for it rested us completely from our  fatigues. I awoke first.   I had scarcely risen from my rather hard couch when I  felt all my faculties clear, and looked about me.   The steward, profiting by our sleep,had cleared the supper-  things away. Nothing indicated an approaching change  in our position, and I asked myself seriously if we were  destined to live indefinitely in that cage.   This prospect seemed to me the more painful because,  though my head was clear, my chest was oppressed. The  heavy air weighed upon my lungs. We had evidently con-  sumed the larger part of the oxygen the cell contained,  although it was large.   I was in deep thought about the possibilities of a terrible  death by suffocation when, suddenly, I was refreshed by a  current of fresh air, loaded with saline odours. It was a sea  breeze, life-giving, and charged with iodine. I opened my  mouth wide, and my lungs became saturated with fresh part-  icles. At the same time I felt the boat roll, and the iron-  plated monster had evidently just ascended to the surface of  the ocean to breathe like the whales. When I had breathed     UNDER THE SEA 47   fully, I looked for the ventilator which had brought us  the beneficent breeze, and, before long found it.   I was making these observations when my two com-  panions awoke nearly at the same time, doubtless through  the influence of the reviving air. They rubbed their eyes,  stretched themselves, and were on foot instantly.    Did monseiur sleep well ?  Conseil asked me with his  usual politeness.    Very well, old fellow. And you, Mr. Land ?     Profoundly, Mr. Professor. But if I am not mis-  taken, I am breathing a sea breeze.   A seaman could not be mistaken in that, and I told the  Canadian what had happened while he was asleep.    That accounts for the roarings we heard when the sup-  posed narwhal was in sight of the Abraham Lincoln.    Yes, Mr. Land, that is its breathing.    I have not the least idea about the time of day, M.  Aronnax, unless it be dinner time.    Dinner time, Ned ? Say breakfast time at least, for  we have certainly slept something like twenty-four hours.    I will not contradict you, answered Ned Land,  but  dinner or breakfast, the steward would be welcome. I wish  he would bring one or the other.    The one and the other, said Conseil.    Certainly, answered the Canadian,  we have right  to two meals, and, for my own part, I shall do honour to  both.    Well, Ned, we must wait, I answered.  It is evident  that those two men had no intention of leaving us to die  of hunger, for in that case there would have been no reason  to give us dinner yesterday.    Unless it is to fatten us !  answered Ned.    I protest, I answered.  We have not fallen into the  hands of cannibals.    One swallow does not make a summer, answered  the Canadian seriously.  Who knows if those fellows  have not been long deprived of fresh meat, and in that case  these healthy and well-constituted individuals like the pro-  fessor, his servant, and me     Drive away such ideas, Mr. Land, I answered,  and     48 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   above all do not act upon them to get into a rage with our  hosts, for that would only make the situation worse.    Any way, said the harpooner, I am devilishly hungry,  and, dinner or breakfast, the meal does not arrive !     Mr. Land, I replied,  we must conform to the rule  of the vessel, and I suppose that our stomachs are in ad-  vance of the steward's bell.    Well, then, we must put them right, answered Conseil  tranquilly.    That is just like you, Conseil, answered the im-  patient Canadian.  You do not use up your bile or your  nerves ! Always calm, you would be capable of saying your  grace before your Benedicite, and of dying of hunger before  you complained.    What is the use of complaining ?  asked Conseil.    It does one good to complain ! It is something. And  if these pirates I say pirates not to vex the professor, who  does not like to hear them called cannibals and if these  pirates think that they are going to keep me in this cage  without hearing how I can swear, they are mistaken. Come  M. Aronnax, speak frankly. Do you think they will keep  us long in this iron box ?     To tell you the truth I know no more about it than  you, friend Land.    But what do you think about it ?     I think that hazard has made us masters of an import-  ant secret. If this secret is of more consequence than the  lives of three men, I believe our existence to be in great  danger. In the contrary case, on the first opportunity, the  monster who has swallowed us will send us back to the world  inhabited by our fellow-men.    Unless he enrols us amongst his crew, said Conseil,   and he keeps us thus    Until some frigate, replied Ned Land,  more rapid or  more skilful than the Abraham Lincoln, masters this nest of  plunderers, and sends its crew and us to breathe our last  at the end of his mainyard.    Well reasoned, Mr. Land, I replied.  But I believe  no proposition of the sort has yet been made to us, so it is  useless to discuss what we should do in that case. I repeat.     UNDER THE SEA 49   we must wait, take counsel of circumstances, and do  nothing, as there is nothing to do.    On the contrary, Mr. Professor, answered the har-  pooner, who would not give up his point,  we must do  something.    What, then ?     Escape.    To escape from an ordinary prison is often difficult, but  from a submarine prison, that seems to me quite im-  practicable.    Come, friend Ned, said Conseil,  what have you to say  to master's objection ? I do not believe an American is  ever at the end of his resources.    Then, M. Aronnax, he said, after some minutes' re-  flection,  you do not guess what men ought to do who  cannot escape from prison ?     No, my friend.    It is very simple ; they must make their arrangements  to stop in it.    I should think so, said Conseil ;  it is much better to  be inside than on the top or underneath.    But after you have thrown your gaolers and keepers  out ?  added Ned Land.    What, Ned ? You seriously think of seizing this ves-  sel ?     Quite seriously, answered the Canadian.    It is impossible.    How so, sir ? A favourable chance may occur, and I  do not see what could prevent us profiting by it. If there  are twenty men on board this machine they will not  frighten two Frenchmen and a Canadian, I suppose.   It was better to admit the proposition of the harpooner  than to discuss it. So I contented myself with answering    Let such an opportunity come, Mr. Land, and we will  see. But until it does I beg of you to contain your im-  patience. We can only act by stratagem, and you will not  make yourself master of favourable chances by getting in a  rage. Promise me, therefore, that you will accept the situ-  ation without too much anger.    I promise you, professor, answered Ned Land in a not     50 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   very assuring tone ;  not a violent word shall leave my  mouth, not an angry movement shall betray me, not  even if we are not waited upon at table with desirable regu-  larity.    I have your word, Ned, I answered.   Then the conversation was suspended, and each of us  began to reflect on his own account. I acknowledge that,  for my own part, and notwithstanding the assurance of the  harpooner, I kept no illusion. I did not admit the probability  of the favourable occasions of which Ned Land had spoken.  To be so well worked the submarine boat must have a numer-  ous crew, and consequently, in case of a struggle, we should  have to do with numbers too great. Besides, before aught  else we must be free, and we were not. And should the  strange commander of the boat have a secret to keep  which appeared at least probable he would not allow us  freedom of movement on board. Now, would he get rid  of us by violence, or would he throw us upon some corner  of earth ? All that was the unknown. All these hypotheses  seemed to me extremely plausible, and one must be a har-  pooner to hope to conquer liberty again.   Ned Land, tormented by the twinges of his robust stom-  ach, became more and more enraged, and notwithstanding  his promise I really feared an explosion when he would again  be in the presence of the men on board.   Two more hours rolled on, and Ned's anger increased ; he  cried and called at the top of his voice, but in vain. The  iron walls were deaf. The boat seemed quite still. The  silence became quite oppressive.   I dare no longer think how long our abandonment and iso-  lation in this cell might last. The hopes that I had con-  ceived after our interview with the commander of the vessel  vanished one by one. The gentle look of this man, the gen-  erous expression of his face, the nobility of his carriage, all  disappeared from my memory. I again saw this enigma-  tical personage such as he must necessarily be, pitiless and  cruel. I felt him to be outside the pale of humanity, inac-  cessible to all sentiment of pity, the implacable enemy of  his fellow-men, to whom he had vowed imperishable hatred.   But was the man going, then, to let us perish ? This     UNDER THE SEA 51   frightful thought became uppermost in my mind, and ima-  gination helping, I felt myself invaded by unreasoning  fear. Conseil remained calm. Ned was roaring. At that  moment a noise was heard outside. Steps clanged on the  metal slabs. The bolts were withdra'vn, the door opened,  the steward appeared.   Before I could make a movement to prevent him the  Canadian had rushed upon the unfortunate fellow, knocked  him down, and fastened on his throat. The steward was  choking under his powerful hand.   Conseil was trying to rescue his half-strangled victim  from the hands of the harpooner, and I was going to join  my efforts to his, when, suddenly, I was riveted to my place  by these words spoken in French :    Calm yourself, Mr. Land, and you, professor, please to  listen to me.   CHAPTER X   THE BOSOM OF THE WATERS   THE man who spoke thus was the commander of the vessel.   When Ned Land heard these words he rose suddenly.  The almost strangled steward went tottering out on a sign  from his master ; but such was the power of the commander  on his vessel that not a gesture betrayed the resentment the  man must have felt towards the Canadian. Conseil,  interested in spite of himself, and I stupefied, awaited  the result of this scene.   The commander, leaning against the angle of the table,  with his arms folded, looked at us with profound attention.  After some minutes of a silence which none of us thought  of interrupting, he said in a calm and penetrating voice   Gentlemen, I speak French, English, German, and Latin  equally well. I might, therefore, have answered you at our  last interview, but I wished to know you first, and after-  wards to ponder on what you said. The stories told by each  of you agreed in the main, and assured me of your identity.  I know now that accident has brought me into the presence  of M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History in the  Paris Museum, charged with a foreign scientific mission, his  servant Conseil, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, har-     52 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   pooner on board the frigate Abraham Lincoln, of the  United States Navy.   I bent my head in sign of assent. There was no answer  necessary. This man expressed himself with perfect  ease, and without the least foreign accent. And yet I felt  that he was not one of my countrymen. He continued  the conversation in these terms :    I dare say you thought me a long time in coming to pay  you this second visit. It was because, after once knowing  your identity, I wished to ponder upon what to do with you.  I hesitated long. The most unfortunate conjuncture of  circumstances has brought you into the presence of a man  who has broken all ties that bound him to humanity. You  came here to trouble my existence     Unintentionally, said I.    Unintentionally, he repeated, raising his voice a little   Is it unintentionally that the Abraham Lincoln pursues  me in every sea ? Was it unintentionally that you took  passage on board her ? Was it unintentionally that your  bullets struck my vessel ? Did Mr. Land throw his harpoon  unintentionally ?     You are doubtless unaware, I answered,  of the com-  motion you have caused in Europe and America. When  the Abraham Lincoln pursued you on the high seas everyone  on board believed they were pursuing a marine monster.   A slight smile curled round the commander's lips, then  he went on in a calmer tone    Dare you affirm, M. Aronnax, that your frigate would  not have pursued a submarine vessel as well as a marine  monster ?    This question embarrassed me, for it was certain that  Captain Farragut would not have hesitated. He would  have thought it as much his duty to destroy such a machine  as the gigantic narwhal he took it to be.    You see, sir, continued the commander,  I have the  right to treat you as enemies.   I answered nothing, and for a very good reason ; the un-  known had force on his side, and it can destroy the best  arguments.    I have long hesitated, continued the commander.     UNDER THE SEA 53    Nothing obliges me to give you hospitality. I could place  you upon the platform of this vessel, upon which you took  refuge, and forget that you ever existed. I should only be  using my right.    The right of a savage, perhaps, I answered,  but not  that of a civilised man.    Professor, quickly answered the commander,  I am  not what is called a civilised man. I have done with so-  ciety entirely for reasons that seem to me good ; therefore  I do not obey its laws, and I desire you never to allude to  them before me again.   A flash of anger and contempt had kindled in the man's  eyes, and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in his life. He  had not only put himself out of the pale of human laws,  but he had made himself independent of them, free, in the  most rigorous sense of the word, entirely out of their reach.  I looked at him with terror mingled with interest, doubt-  less as CEdipus considered the Sphinx.   After a rather long silence the commander went on speak-  ing.    I have hesitated, therefore, said he,  but I thought  that my interest might be reconciled with that natural pity  to which every human being has a right. You may remain  on my vessel, since fate has brought you to it. You will be  free, and in exchange for this liberty, which after all will  be relative, I shall only impose one condition upon you.  Your word of honour to submit to it will be sufficient.     Speak, sir, I answered.  I suppose this condition is  one that an honest man can accept ?     Yes ; it is this : It is possible that certain unforeseen  events may force me to consign you to your cabin for some  hours, or even days. As I do not wish to use violence, I ex-  pect from you, in such a case, more than from all others,  passive obedience. By acting thus I take all the responsi-  bility ; I acquit you entirely, by making it impossible for  you to see what ought not to be seen. Do you accept  the condition ?    So things took place on board which were, at least, singu-  lar, and not to be seen by people who were not placed  beyond the pale of social laws.     54 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    We accept, I replied.  Only I ask your permission  to address to you one question only one. What degree  of liberty do you intend giving us ?     The liberty to move about freely and observe even all  that passes here except under rare circumstances in  short, the liberty that my companions and I enjoy our-  selves.   It was evident that we did not understand each other.    Pardon me, sir, I continued,  but this liberty is only  that of every prisoner to pace his prison. It is not enough  for us.    You must make it enough.    Do you mean to say we must for ever renounce the idea  of seeing country, friends, and relations again ?     Yes, sir. But to renounce the unendurable worldly  yoke that men call liberty is not perhaps so painful as you  think.    I declare, said Ned Land, I'll never give my word  of honour not to try to escape.    I did not ask for your word of honour, Mr. Land,  answered the commander coldly.    Sir, I replied, carried away in spite of myself,  you  take advantage of your position towards us. It is cruel !     No, sir, it is kind. You are my prisoners of war.  You attacked me. You came and surprised a secret that  I mean no man inhabiting the world to penetrate the  secret of my whole existence. And you think that I am  going to send you back to that world ? Never ! In re-  taining you it is not you I guard, it is myself !    These words indicated that the commander's mind was  made up, and that argument was useless.    Then, sir, I answered,  you give us the simple choice  between life and death ?     As you say.    My friends, said I,  to a question thus put there is  nothing to answer. But no word of honour binds us to  the master of this vessel.    None, sir, answered the unknown.   Then in a gentler voice he went on    Now allow me to finish what I have to say to you.     UNDER THE SEA 55   I know you, M. Aronnax. You, if not your companions,  will not have so much to complain of in the chance that  has bound you to my lot. You will find amongst the books  which are my favourite study the work you have published  on the Great Submarine Grounds. I have often read it.  You have carried your investigations as far as terrestrial  science allowed you. But on board my vessel you will  have an opportunity of seeing what no man has seen be-  fore. Thanks to me, our planet will give up her last secrets.   I cannot deny that these words had a great effect upon  me. My weak point was touched, and I forgot for a mo-  ment that the contemplation of these divine things was  not worth the loss of liberty. Besides, I counted upon  the future to decide that grave question, and so contented  myself with saying    What name am I to call you by, sir ?     Captain Nemo, answered the commander.  That is  all I am to you, and you and your companions are nothing  to me but the passengers of the Nautilus.   The captain called, and a steward appeared. The cap-  tain gave him his orders in that foreign tongue which I  could not understand. Then turning to the Canadian and  Conseil    Your meal is prepared in your cabin, he said to them.  Be so good as to follow that man.   My two companions in misfortune left the cell where  they had been confined for more than thirty hours.    And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready. Allow  me to lead the way.   I followed Captain Nemo into a sort of corridor lighted  by electricity, similar to the waist of a ship. After going  about a dozen yards a second door opened before me into a  kind of dining-room, decorated and furnished with severe  taste. High oaken sideboards, inlaid with ebony orna-  ments, stood at either end of the room, and on their shelves  glittered china, porcelain, and glass of inestimable value.  The plate that was on them sparkled in the light which  shone from the ceiling, tempered and softened by fine paint-  ing. In the centre of the room was a table richly spread.  Captain Nemo pointed to my seat.     56 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Sit down, said he,  and eat like a man who must be  dying of hunger.   The breakfast consisted of a number of dishes, the con-  tents of which were all furnished by the sea. They were  good, but had a peculiar flavour which I soon became accus-  tomed to. They appeared to be rich in phosphorus.   Captain Nemo looked at me. I asked him no questions,  but he guessed my thoughts, and said    Most of these dishes are unknown to you, but you can  eat of them without fear. They are wholesome and nour-  ishing. I have long renounced the food of the earth, and  I am none the worse for it. My crew, who are healthy,  have the same food.    Then all these dishes are the produce of the sea ?   said I.    Yes, professor, the sea supplies all my needs. Some-  times I cast my nets in tow, and they are drawn in ready  to break. Sometimes I go and hunt in the midst of this  element, which seems inaccessible to man, and run down  the game of submarine forests. My flocks, like those of  Neptune's old shepherd, graze fearlessly the immense  ocean meadows. I have a vast estate there, which I culti-  vate myself, and which is always stocked by the Creator  of all things.   I looked at Captain Nemo with some astonishment, and  answered    I can quite understand that your nets should furnish  excellent fish for your table, and that you should pursue  aquatic game in your submarine forests ; but I do not  understand how a particle of meat can find its way into  your bill of fare.    What you believe to be meat, professor, is nothing but  fillet of turtle. Here also are dolphins' livers, which you  might take for a highly-seasoned stew of pork. My cook is  a clever fellow, who excels in preparing these various  products of the sea. Taste all these dishes. Here is a  conserve of holothuria, which a Malay would declare to be  unrivalled in the world ; here is a cream furnished by the  cetacea, and the sugar by the great fucus of the North  Sea ; and, lastly, allow me to offer you some anemone pre-     UNDER THE SEA 57   serve, which equals that made irom the most delicious fruits.   Whilst I was tasting, more from curiosity than as a  gourmet, Captain Nemo enchanted me with extraordinary  stories.    Not only does the sea feed me, he continued,  but  it clothes me too. These materials that clothe you are  wrought from the byssus of certain shells ; they are dyed  with the purple of the ancients, and the violet shades which  I extract from the aplysis of the Mediterranean. The  perfumes you will find on the toilette of your cabin are  produced from the distillation of marine plants. Your bed  is made with the softest wrack-grass of the ocean. Your  pen will be a whale's fin, your ink the liquor secreted by  the calamary. Everything now comes to me from the sea,  and everything will one day return to it 1     You love the sea, captain ?     Yes, I love it. The sea is everything. It covers seven-  tenths of the terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and  healthy. It is an immense desert where man is never alone,  for he feels life quivering around him on every side. The  sea is only the medium of a preternatural and wonderful  existence ; it is only movement and love ; it is the infinite  with life breathed into it, as one of your poets has said.  And in reality, professor, Nature is manifested in it by her  three kingdoms mineral, vegetable, and animal. This  last is largely represented by the four groups of zoophytes,  by three classes of vertebrates, mammals, reptiles, and  those innumerable legions of fish, an infinite order of  animals that counts more than 13,000 species, of which a  tenth only belongs to fresh water. The sea is the vast  reservoir of Nature. It is by the sea that the globe has,  so to speak, commenced, and who knows if it will not end  by it ? There is supreme tranquillity. The sea does not  belong to despots. On its surface iniquitous rights can  still be exercised, men can fight there, devour each other  there, and transport all terrestrial horrors there. But at  thirty feet below its level their power ceases, their influence  dies out, their might disappears. Ah, sir, live in the bosom  of the waters ! There alone is independence ! There I  recognise no masters ! There I am free 1      58 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Captain Nemo stopped suddenly in the midst of this  burst of enthusiasm which overflowed in him. Had he  let himself be carried out of his habitual reserve ? Had  he said too much ? During some moments he walked about  much agitated. Then his face regained its usual calm ex-  pression, and turning towards me    Now, professor, said he,  if you wish to visit the  Nautilus, I am at your service.   CHAPTER XI   THE  NAUTILUS    CAPTAIN NEMO rose, and I followed him. A folding door,  contrived at the back of the room, opened, and I entered  a room about the same size as the one I had just left.   It was a library. High bookcases of black rosewood  supported on their shelves a great number of books in uni-  form binding. They went round the room, terminating  at their lower part in large divans, covered with brown  leather, curved so as to afford the greatest comfort. Light  movable desks, made to slide in and out at will, were there  to rest one's book while reading. In the centre was a vast  table, covered with pamphlets, amongst which appeared  some newspapers, already old. The electric light flooded  this harmonious whole, and was shed from four polished  globes half sunk in the volutes of the ceiling. This room  so ingeniously fitted up, excited my admiration, and I  could scarcely believe my eyes.    Captain Nemo, said I to my host, who had just thrown  himself on one of the divans,  you have a library here that  would do honour to more than one continental palace, and  I am lost in wonder when I think that it can follow you to  the greatest depths of the ocean.    Where could there be more solitude or more silence,  professor ?  answered Captain Nemo.  Did your study  in the museum offer you as complete quiet ?     No, and I must acknowledge it is a very poor one com-  pared with yours. You must have from six to seven  thousand volumes here.    Twelve thousand M. Aronnax. These are the only     UNDER THE SEA 59   ties between me and the earth. But the day that my  Nautilus plunged for the first time beneath the waters the  world was at an end for me. These books, professor, are  at your disposition, and you can use them freely.   I thanked Captain Nemo, and went up to the library  shelves. Books of science, ethics, and literature written  in every language were there ; but I did not see a single  work on political economy amongst them ; they seemed to  be severely prohibited. A curious detail was that all these  books were classified indistinctly, in whatever language  they were written, and this confusion showed that ths  captain of the Nautilus could read with the utmost facility  any volume he might take up by chance.   Amongst these works I noticed the principal productions  of the ancient and modern masters that is to say, all the  finest things that humanity has produced in history, poetry,  romance, and science. But science, more particularly,  was represented in this library. Amongst the works of  Joseph Bertrand, his book, entitled, Le Fondateur de V As-  tronomic, gave me a certain date ; and as I knew that it  had appeared during the course of 1865, I could conclude  from that that the launching of the Nautilus did not take  place at a later date. It was, therefore, three years, at the  most, since Captain Nemo began his submarine existence.  I hope, besides, that more recent works still will allow me  to fix exactly the epoch ; but I should have time to make  that research, and I did not wish to delay any longer our  inspection of the marvels of the Nautilus.    Sir, said I to the captain,  I thank you for placing  this library at my disposal. I see it contains treasures of  science, and I shall profit by them.    This room is not only a library, said Captain Nemo ;  it is a smoking-room too.    A smoking-room ?  cried I.  Do you smoke here,  then ?     Certainly.    Then, sir, I am forced to believe that you have kept up  relations with Havannah ?     No, I have not, answered the captain.  Accept this  cigar, M. Aronnax ; although it does not come from Havan-     60 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   nah, you will be pleased with it if you are a connoisseur.   I took the cigar that was offered me ; it seemed to be  made of leaves of gold. I lighted it at a little brazier which  was supported on an elegant bronze pedestal, and drew the  first whiffs with the delight of an amateur who has not  smoked for two days.    It is excellent, said I,  but it is not tobacco.    No, answered the captain.  This tobacco comes  neither from Havannah nor the East. It i? a sort of sea-  weed, rich in nicotine, with which the sea supplies me, but  somewhat sparingly.    As Captain Nemo spoke he opened the opposite door to  the one by which we had entered the library, and I passed  into an immense and brilliantly-lighted saloon. It was  a vast four-sided room, with panelled walls, measuring  thirty feet by eighteen, and about fifteen feet high. A lumi-  nous ceiling, decorated with light arabesques, distributed  a soft, clear light over all the marvels collected in the  museum. For it was, in fact, a museum in which an  indefatigable hand had gathered together all the treasures  of nature and art with the artistic confusion of a painter's  studio.   About thirty pictures by the first artists, uniformly  framed and separated by brilliant drapery, were hung on  tapestry of severe design. I saw there works of great  value, most of which I had admired in the special collections  of Europe, and in exhibitions of paintings. The amaze-  ment which the captain of the Nautilus had predicted had  already begun to take possession of me.    Professor, then said this strange man,  you must  excuse the unceremonious way in which I receive you, and  the disorder of this room.    Sir, I answered,  without seeking to know who you  are, may I be allowed to recognise in you an artist ?     Only an amateur, sir. Formerly I liked to collect  these works of art. I was a greedy collector and an inde-  fatigable antiquary, and have been able to get together  some objects of great value. These are my last gatherings  from that world which is now dead to me. In my eyes your  modern artists are already old ; they have two or three     UNDER THE SEA 61   thousand years of existence, and all masters are of the same  age in my mind.    And these musicians ?  said I, pointing to the works of  Weber, Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer,  Herold, Wagner, Auber, Gounod, and many others, scat-  tered over a large piano organ fixed in one of the panels  of the room.    These musicians, answered Captain Nemo,  are con-  temporaries of Orpheus, for all chronological differences are  effaced in the memory of the dead ; and I am dead, as much  dead as those of your friends who are resting six feet under  the earth 1    Captain Nemo ceased talking, and seemed lost in a pro-  found reverie. I looked at him with great interest, analy-  sing in silence the strange expressions of his face.   Leaning on the corner of a costly mosaic table, he no  longer saw me, and forgot my presence.   I respected his meditation, and went on passing in review  the curiosities that enriched the saloon. They consisted  principally of marine plants, shells, and other productions of  the ocean, which must have been found by Captain Nemo  himself. In the centre of the saloon rose a jet of water  lighted up by electricity, and falling into a basin formed of  a single tridacne shell, measuring about seven yards in cir-  cumference. It surpassed in size the beautiful gifts to  Francis I. of France by the Venetian Republic, and that  now form two basins for holy water in the church of Saint  Sulpice in Paris.   All round this basin were elegant glass cases, fastened by  copper rivets, in which were classed and labelled the most  precious productions of the sea that had ever been presented  to the eye of a naturalist. My delight as a professor may  be imagined.   Apart and in special apartments were spread out chaplets  of pearls of the greatest beauty, and of all colours which the  electric light pricked with points of fire. Some of these  pearls were bigger than a pigeon's egg, and were worth  more than the one which the traveller Tavernier sold to the  Shah of Persia for 3,000,000 francs, and surpassed the one  in the possession of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had  believed to be unrivalled in the world.      62 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   It was impossible to estimate the worth of this collection.  Captain Nemo must have spent millions in acquiring these  various specimens, and I was asking myself from whence  he had drawn the money to gratify his fancy for collecting,  when I was interrupted by these words :    You are examining my shells, professor. They cer-  tainly must be interesting to a naturalist, but for me they  have a greater charm, for I have collected them all myself,  and there is not a sea on the face of the globe that has es-  caped my search.    I understand, captain I understand the delight of  moving amongst such riches. You are one of those people  who lay up treasures for themselves. There is not a mu-  seum in Europe that possesses such a collection of marine  products. But if I exhaust all my admiration upon it, I  shall have none left for the vessel that carries it. I do not  wish to penetrate into your secrets, but I must confess that  this Nautilus, with the motive power she contains, the con-  trivances by which she is worked, the powerful agent which  propels her, all excite my utmost curiosity. I see hung  on the walls of this room instruments the use of which I  ignore.    When I told you that you were free on board my vessel,  I meant that every portion of the Nautilus was open to  your inspection. The instruments you will see in my room,  professor, where I shall have much pleasure in explaining  their use to you. But come and look at your own cabin.  I followed Captain Nemo, who, by one of the doors open-  ing from each panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist  of the vessel. He conducted me aft, and there I found,  not a cabin, but an elegant room with a bed, toilette-table,  and several other articles of furniture. I could only thank  my host.    Your room is next to mine, said he, opening a door j   and mine opens into the saloon we have just left.   I entered the captain's room ; it had a severe, almost  monastic aspect. A small iron bedstead, an office desk,  some articles of toilet all lighted by a strong light. There  were no comforts, only the strictest necessaries.  Captain Nemo pointed to a seat.     UNDER THE SEA 63      Pray, sit down, he said.   I obeyed, and he began thus :     CHAPTER XII   EVERYTHING BY ELECTRICITY    SIR, said Captain Nemo, showing me the instruments  hung on the walls of the room,  here are the instru-  ments necessary for the navigation of the Nautilus. Here,  as in the saloon, I have them always before me, and they in-  dicate my position and exact direction in the midst of the  ocean. You are acquainted with some of them the  thermometer, for instance which gives the internal tem-  perature of the vessel ; the barometer, indicating the  weight of the air, and foretelling changes in the weather ;  the hygrometer, for indicating the degree of dryness in the  atmosphere ; the storm-glass, the contents of which decom-  pose at the approach of tempests ; the compass, for guid-  ing our course ; the sextant, for taking latitude ; chrono-  meters, for calculating longitude ; and, lastly, the glasses  for day and night, which I use to examine the horizon when  the Nautilus rises to the surface of the waves.    Yes, I answered ; I understand the usual nautical  instruments. But I see others that doubtless answer the  peculiar requirements of your vessel. That dial with a mov-  able needle is a manometer, is it not ?     Yes ; by communication with the water it indicates  the exterior pressure and gives our depth at the same time.    And these sounding-lines of a novel kind ?     They give the temperature of the different depths of  water.    And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot  guess ?     Here I ought to give you some explanation, professor.  There is a powerful, obedient, rapid, and easy agent which  lends itself to all uses, and reigns supreme here. We do  everything by its means. It is the light, warmth, and soul  of my mechanical apparatus. This agent is electricity.    Yet, captain, you possess an extreme rapidity of     64 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   movement which does not well agree with the power of  electricity. Until now its dynamic force has been very  restricted, and has only produced little power.    Professor, answered Captain Nemo,  my electricity  is re. everybody's, and you will permit me to withhold  any further information.'    I will not insist, sir ; I will content myself with being  astonished at such wonderful results. A single question,  however, I will ask, which you need not answer if it is an in-  discreet one. The elements which you employ to produce  this marvellous agent must necessarily be soon consumed.  The zinc, for instance, that you use how do you obtain a  fresh supply ? You now have no communication with the  land ? '    I will answer your question, replied Captain Nemo.   In the first place I must inform you that there exists,  at the bottom of the sea, mines of zinc, iron, silver, and gold,  the working of which would most certainly be practicable ;  but I am not indebted to any of these terrestrial metals.  I was determined to seek from the sea alone the means ot  producing my electricity.    From the sea ?     Yes, professor, and I was at no loss to find these means.  It would have been possible, by establishing a circuit be-  tween wires plunged to different depths, to obtain electricity  by the diversity of temperature to which they would have  been exposed ; but I preferred to employ a more practica-  ble system.    And what was that ?     You know of the composition of sea- water ? In 1,000  grammes of sea- water you find 96 J centigrammes of pure  water, and about 2 centigrammes of chloride of sodium ;  in addition, small quantities of the chlorides of magnesium  and potassium, bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magne-  sia, sulphate and carbonate of lime. You see, then, that  chloride of sodium forms a notable proportion of it. Now  it is this sodium that I extract from seawater, and of which  I compose my ingredients. Mixed with mercury it takes  the place of zinc for the voltaic pile. The mercury is never  exhausted ; only the sodium is consumed, and the sea itself     UNDER THE SEA 65   gives me that. Besides, the electric power of the sodium  piles is double that of the zinc ones.    I clearly understand, captain, the convenience of so-  dium in the circumstances in which you are placed. The  sea contains it. Good. But you still have to make it, tc  extract it, in a word. And how do you do that ? Youi  pile would evidently serve the purpose of extracting it ;  but unless I am mistaken, the consumption of sodium  necessitated by the electrical apparatus would exceed the  quantity extracted. The consequence would be that you  would consume more of it than you would produce.    That is why I do not extract it by the pile, my dear pro-  fessor. I employ nothing but the heat of coal.   Coal !  I urged.    We will call it sea-coal if you like, replied Captain  Nemo.    And are you able tc work submarine coal-mines ?    You shall see me so employed, M. Aronnax. I only  ask you for a little patience ; you have time to be patient  here. Only remember I get everything from the ocean.  It produces electricity, and electricity supplies the Nautilus  with light in a word, with life.   But not with the air you breathe.   I could produce the air necessary for my consumption,  but I do not, because I go up to the surface of the water  when I please. But though electricity does not furnish me  with the air to breathe, it works the powerful pumps which  store it up in special reservoirs, and which enable me to  prolong at need, and as long as I like, my stay in the depths  of the sea.    Captain, I replied,  I can do nothing but admire.  You have evidently discovered what mankind at large will,  no doubt, one day discover, the veritable dynamic power  of electricity.    Whether they will discover it I do not know, replied  Captain Nemo coldly.  However that may be, you now  know the first application that I have made of this precious  agent. It is electricity that furnishes us with a light that  surpasses in uniformity and continuity that of the sun itself.  Look now at this clock ! It is an electric one, and goes     66 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   with a regularity that defies the best of chronometers. I  have divided it into twenty-four hours, because there  exists for me neither night nor day, sun nor moon, only this  factitious light that I take with me to the bottom of the sea.  Look ! just now it is ten a.m.   Exactly so.    This dial hanging in front of us indicates the speed of the  Nautilus. An electric wire puts it into communication  with the screw. Look ! just now we are going along at the  moderate speed of fifteen miles an hour. But we have not  finished yet, M. Aronnax, continued Captain Nemo,  rising,  if you will follow me we will visit the stern of  the Nautilus   I already knew all the anterior part of this submarine  boat, of which the following is the exact division, starting  from the centre to the prow : The dining-room, 15 feet  long, separated from the library by a water-tight partition ;  the library, 15 feet long ; the large saloon, 30 feet long,  separated from the captain's room by a second water-tight  partition ; the captain's room, 15 feet ; mine, 9 feet ; and  lastly, a reservoir of air of 20 feet that reached to the prow ;  total, 104 feet. The partitions had doors that were shut  hermetically by means of indiarubber, assuring the safety  of the Nautilus in case of a leak.   I followed Captain Nemo across the waist, and in the  centre of the boat came to a sort of well that opened be-  tween two water-tight partitions. An iron ladder, fastened  by an iron hook to the partition, led to the upper end. I  asked the captain what it was for.    It leads to the boat, answered he.    What ! have you a boat ?  I exclaimed in astonish-  ment.    Certainly, an excellent one, light and unsinkable, that  serves either for fishing or pleasure trips.    Then when you wish to embark you are obliged to go  up to the surface of the water.    Not at all. The boat is fixed on the top of the Nautilus  in a cavity made for it. It has a deck, is water-tight,  and fastened by solid bolts. This ladder leads to a man-  hole in the hull of the Nautilus, corresponding to a similar     UNDER THE SEA 67   hole in the boat. It is by this double opening that I get to  the boat. The one is shut by my men in the vessel, I shut  the one in the boat by means of screw pressure, I undo the  bolts, and the little boat darts up to the surface of the sea  with prodigious rapidity. I then open the panel of the deck,  carefully closed before, I mast it, hoist my sail, take my  oars, and am off.    But how do you return ?     I do not return to it ; it comes to me.    At your order ?     At my order. An electric wire connects us. I tele-  graph my orders.    Really, I said, amazed by such marvels,  nothing  can be more simple !    After having passed the companion-ladder that led to  the platform I saw a cabin about twelve feet long, in which  Conseil and Ned Land were devouring their meal. Then a  door opened upon a kitchen nine feet long, situated between  the vast store-rooms of the vessel. There electricity,  better than gas itself, did all the cooking. The wires under  the stoves communicated with platinum sponges, and gave  out a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed.  They also heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evapora-  tion, furnished excellent drinking water. A bath-room,  comfortably furnished with hot and cold water taps, opened  out of this kitchen.   Next to the kitchen was the berth-room of the vessel,  eighteen feet long. But the door was closed, and I could  not see how it was furnished, so I could not get an idea of  the number of men employed on board the Nautilus. At  the far end was a fourth partition, which separated this  room from the engine-room. A door opened, and I entered  the compartment where Captain Nemo certainly a first-  rate engineer had arranged his locomotive machinery.  It was divided into two parts ; the first contained the  materials for producing electricity, and the second the  machinery that moved the screw. I was at first surprised  at a gaseous smell which filled the compartment. The  captain saw that I perceived it.    It is only a slight escape of gas produced by the use of     68 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   the sodium, and not much inconvenience, as every morning  we purify the vessel by ventilating it in the open air.   In the meantime I was examining the machinery with  great interest.    You see, said the captain,  I use Bunsen's elements,  not Ruhmkorff's they would not have been powerful  enough. Bunsen's are fewer in number, but strong and  large, which experience proves to be the best. The electri-  city produced passes to the back, where it works by  electro-magnets of great size on a peculiar system of levers  and cog-wheels that transmit the movement to the axle of  the screw. This one, with a diameter of nineteen feet and  a thread twenty-three feet, performs about a hundred and  twenty revolutions in a second.    What speed do you obtain from it ?     About fifty miles an hour.   Here was a mystery, but I did not press for a solution of it.    Captain Nemo, I replied,  I recognise the results, and  do not seek for an explanation. I saw the Nautilus worked  in the presence of the Abraham Lincoln, and I know  what to think of its speed. But it is not enough to  be able to walk ; you must see where you are going ; you  must be able to direct yourself to the right or left, above  or below. How do you reach the great depths, where you  find an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of  atmospheres ? How do you return to the surface of the  ocean, or maintain yourself at the proper depth ? Am I  indiscreet in asking you this question ?     Not at all, professor, answered the captain, after a  slight hesitation.  As you are never to leave this sub-  marine boat, come into the saloon it is our true study  and there you shall learn all you want to know about the  Nautilus.   CHAPTER XIII   SUBMARINE PALACE   A MOMENT afterwards we were seated on a divan in the  saloon, with our cigars. The captain spread out a diagram  that gave the plan of the Nautilus. Then he began his  description in these terms :     UNDER THE SEA 69    Here, M. Aronnax, are the different dimensions of the  vessel you are in. It is a very elongated cylinder, with  conical ends, much like a cigar in shape a shape already  adopted in London for constructions of the same sort.  The length of this cylinder, from one end to the other, 13  exactly 232 feet, and its maximum breadth is 26 feet. It  is, therefore, not altogether constructed by tenths, like  your quick steamers, but its lines are sufficiently long, and  its slope lengthened out to allow the displaced water to  escape easily, and opposes no obstacle to its speed. These  two dimensions allow you to obtain, by a simple calcula-  tion, the surface and volume of the Nautilus. Its surface  is 1,011 metres and 45 centimetres ; its volume, 1,500 cubic  metres and two-tenths, which is the same as saying that it is  entirely immersed. It displaces 50,000 feet of water, or  weighs 1,500 tons.    When I made the plans for this vessel I wished that  when it was in equilibrium nine-tenths of it should be under  water, and one-tenth only should emerge. Consequently,  under these conditions, it only ought to displace nine-tenths  of its volume, or 1,356 cubic metres and 48 centimetres  that is to say, it only ought to weigh the same number of  tons. I therefore did not exceed this weight in construct-  ing it according to the above-named dimensions.    The Nautilus is composed of two hulls, one inside the  other, and joined together by T shaped irons, which  make it very strong.    These two hulls are made of steel plates, the density of  which is to water seven eight-tenths. The first is not less  than five centimetres thick, and weighs 394 '96 tons. The  second envelope, the keel, is 50 centimetres high and 25  wide, weighing by itself 62 tons ; the machine, ballast,  different accessories, the interior partitions and props weigh  961 tons, which, added to the rest, form the required total  of i, 356 '48 tons. Do you follow me ?   ' Yes, I replied.    Then, continued the captain,  when the Nautilus is  afloat in these conditions one-tenth is out of the water. I  have placed reservoirs of a size equal to this tenth capable  of holding 15072 tons, and when I fill them with water the     70 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   vessel becomes completely immersed. These reservoirs  exist in the lowest parts of the Nautilus.    Well, captain, but now we arrive at the real difficulty.  When you plunge below the surface, does not your sub-  marine apparatus meet with a pressure from below, which  must be equal to one atmosphere for every thirty feet of  water, or one kilogramme for every square centimetre ?     True, sir.    Then unless you fill the Nautilus entirely I do not see  how you can draw it down into the bosom of the liquid mass.    Professor, answered Captain Nemo,  you must not con-  found statics with dynamics, or you will expose yourself to  grave errors. There is very little work necessary to reach  the lowest depths of the ocean, for bodies have a tendency  ' to sink.' Follow my reasoning.    I am listening to you, captain.    When I wished to determine the increase of weight that  must be given to the Nautilus to sink it, I had only to occupy  myself with the reduction in volume which sea-water ex-  periences as it becomes deeper and deeper.    That is evident, said I.    Now if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is, at  least, very slightly compressible in fact, according to the  most recent calculations '0000436 in an atmosphere or in  each thirty feet of depth. If I wish to go to the depth of  1,000 metres I take into account the reduction of volume  under a pressure equivalent to that of a column of water of  1,000 metres that is to say, under a pressure of 100 atmo-  spheres. I ought, therefore, to increase the weight so as to  weigh 1,51379 tons instead of 1,5072 tons. The augmen-  tation will, consequently, only be 677 tons. Only that,  Monsieur Aronnax, and the calculation is easy to verify.  Now I have supplementary reservoirs capable of embarking  100 tons. I can, therefore, descend to considerable depths.  When I wish to remount to the level of the surface, I have  only to let out this water, and to entirely empty all the  reservoirs, if I desire that the Nautilus should emerge one-  tenth of its total capacity.   To this reasoning, founded upon figures, I had nothing  to object.     UNDER THE SEA 71    I admit your calculations, captain, I replied,  but I  foresee a real difficulty.    What is that, sir ?     When you are at the depth of 1,000 yards the sides of the  Nautilus support a pressure of 100 atmospheres. If, there-  fore, at this moment you wish to empty the supplementary  reservoirs to lighten your vessel and ascend to the surface,  the pumps must conquer this pressure of 100 atmospheres,  which is that of 100 kilogrammes for every square centi-  metre. Hence a power     Which electricity alone can give me, hastened to say  Captain Nemo.  I repeat, sir, that the dynamic power of  my machines is nearly infinite. The pumps of the Nautilus  have prodigious force, which you must have seen when their  columns of water were precipitated like a torrent over the  Abraham Lincoln. Besides, I only use supplementary  reservoirs to obtain middle depths of 1,500 to 2,000 metres,  and that in order to save my apparatus. When the fancy  takes me to visit the depths of the ocean at two or three  leagues below its surface, I use longer means, but no less  infallible.    What are they, captain ?  I asked.    That involves my telling you how the Naittilus is  worked.    I am all impatience to hear it.    In order to steer my vessel horizontally I use an ordin-  ary rudder, worked by a wheel and a tackle. But I can also  move the Nautilus by a vertical movement, by means of  two inclined planes fastened to the sides and at the centre  of flotation, planes that can move in every direction, and  are worked from the interior by means of powerful levers.  When these planes are kept parallel with the boat it moves  horizontally ; when slanted, the Nautilus, according to  their inclination, and under the influence of the screw,  either sinks according to an elongated diagonal, or rises  diagonally as it suits me. And even when I wish to rise  more quickly to the surface I engage the screw, and the  pressure of the water causes the Nautilus to rise vertically  like a balloon into the air.    Bravo ! captain, I cried.  But how can the helms-     72 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   man follow the route you give him in the midst of the  waters ?     The helmsman is placed in a glass cage jutting from the  top of the Nautilus and furnished with lenses.    Capable of resisting such pressure ?     Perfectly. Glass, which a blow can break, offers, never-  theless, considerable resistance. During some fishing ex-  periments we made in i864,by electric light, in the Northern  Seas, we saw plates less than a third of an inch thick resist  a pressure of sixteen atmospheres. Now the glass that I  use is not less than thirty times thicker.    I see now. But, after all, it is dark under water ; how  do you see where you are going ?     There is a powerful electric reflector placed behind the  helmsman's cage, the rays from which light up the sea for  half a mile in front.    Ah, now I can account for the phosphorescence in the  supposed narwhal that puzzled me so. May I ask you if  the damage you did to the Scotia was due to an accident ?    Yes, it was quite accidental. I was sailing only one  fathom below the surface when the shock came. Had it  any bad result ?     None, sir. But how about the shock you gave the  Abraham Lincoln ?     Professor, it was a great pity for one of the best ships in  the American navy ; but they attacked me and I had to  defend myself ! Besides, I contented myself with putting  it out of the power of the frigate to harm me ; there will be  no difficulty in getting her repaired at the nearest port.    Ah, commander !  I cried with conviction,  your  Nautilus is certainly a marvellous boat.    Yes, professor, answered Captain Nemo with real emo-  tion,  and I love it as if it were flesh of my flesh. Though  all is danger on one of your ships in subjection to the hazards  of the ocean, though on this sea the first impression is the  sentiment of unfathomable depth, as the Dutchman Jansen  has so well said, below and on board the Nautilus the  heart of man has nothing to dread. There is no defor-  mation to fear, for the double hull of this vessel is as rigid  as iron : no rigging to be injured by rolling and pitching)     UNDER THE SEA 73   no sails for the wind to carry away ; no boilers for steam to  blow up ; no fire to dread, as the apparatus is made of iron  and not of wood ; no coal to get exhausted, as electricity  is its mechanical agent ; no collision to fear, as it is the only  vessel in deep waters ; no tempests to set at defiance, as  there is perfect tranquility at some yards below the surface  of the sea 1 The Nautilus is the ship of ships, sir. And if  it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the ves-  sel than the constructor, and the constructor more than the  captain himself, you will understand with what confidence  I trust to my Nautilus, as I am at the same time captain,  constructor, and engineer.   Captain Nemo spoke with captivating eloquence. His  fiery look and passionate gestures transfigured him. Yes !  he did love his vessel like a father loves his child !   But a question, perhaps an indiscreet one, came up natur-  ally, and I could not help putting it.    Then you are an engineer, Captain Nemo ?     Yes, professor, I studied in London, Paris, and New  York, when I was still an inhabitant of the world's con-  tinents.    But how could you construct this admirable Nautilus  in secret ?     I had each separate portion made in different parts of  the globe, and it reached me through a disguised address.  The keel was forged at Creuzot, the shaft of the screw at  Penn and Co.'s, of London; the iron plates of the hull at  Laird's, of Liverpool ; the screw itself at Scott's, of Glasgow.  Its reservoirs were made by Cail and Co., of Paris ; the  engine by the Prussian Krupp ; the prow in Motala's  workshop in Sweden ; the mathematical instruments by  Hart Brothers, of New York, etc. ; all of these people had  my orders under different names.    But how did you get all the parts put together ?     I set up a workshop upon a desert island in the ocean.  There, my workmen that is to say, my brave companions  whom I instructed and I put together our Nautilus.  When the work was ended, fire destroyed all trace of our  proceedings on the island, which I should have blown up if I  could.     74 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    It must have cost you a great deal. v   The Nautilus cost 67,500 to build, and 80,000 more for  ( fitting up ; altogether, with the works of art and collections  it contains, it cost about 200,000.    One last question, Captain Nemo.    Ask it, professor.    You must be rich ?     Immensely rich, sir ; and I could, without missing u,  pay the English National Debt.   I stared at the singular person who spoke thus. Was he  taking advantage of my credulity ? The future alone could  decide.   CHAPTER XIV   THE BLACK RIVER   THE Pacific Ocean is the smoothest of all seas ; its currents  are wide and slow, its tides slight, its rains abundant.  Such was the ocean that my destiny called upon me to go  over under such strange conditions.    Now, professor, said Captain Nemo,  we will, if you  please take our bearings and fix the starting-point of this  voyage. It wants a quarter to twelve. I am going up to  the surface of the water.   The captain pressed an electric bell three times. The  pumps began to drive the water out of the reservoirs ;  the needle of the manometer marked by the different pres-  sures the upward movement of the Nautilus, then it  stopped.    We have arrived, said the captain.   We went to the central staircase which led up to the plat-  form, climbed the iron steps, and found ourselves on the  top of the Nautilus.   The platform was only three feet out of the water. The  front and back of the Nautilus were of that spindle shape  which caused it justly to be compared to a cigar. I noticed  that its iron plates slightly overlaid each other, like the  scales on the body of our large land reptiles. I well under-  stood how this boat should have been taken for a marine  animal.   Towards the middle of the platform, the boat, half sunk     UNDER THE SEA 75   In the vessel, formed a slight excrescence. Fore and aft  rose two cages of medium height, with inclined sides, and  partly inclosed by thick lenticular glasses. In the one  was the helmsman who directed the Nautilus ', in the other  a powerful electric lantern that lighted up his course.   The sea was beautiful, the sky pure. The long vessel  could hardly feel the broad undulations of the ocean. The  horizon was quite clear, making observation eaty. There  was nothing in sight nothing but a waste of waters.   Captain Nemo took the altitude of the sun with his sex-  tant to get his latitude. He waited some minutes till the  planet came on a level with the edge of the horizon. Whilst  he was observing not one of his muscles moved, and the  instrument would not have been more motionless in a hand  of marble.    It is noon. Professor, when you are ready    I cast a last look at the sea, and went down again to the  saloon.   There the captain made his point, and calculated his  longitude chronometrically, which he controlled by pre-  ceding observations of horary angles. Then he said to  me    M. Aronnax, we are about three hundred miles from  the coasts of Japan. To-day, the 8th of November, at  noon, our voyage of exploration nn ler the waters begins.    God preserve us !  I answ< re I.    And now, professor, added the captain,  I leave you  to your studies. I have given E.N.E. as our route at a depth  of fifty yards. Here are maps on a large scale on which  you can follow it. The saloon is at your disposition, and  I ask your permission to withdraw.   Captain Nemo bowed to me. I remained alone, ab-  sorbed in my thoughts. All of them referred to the com-  mander of the Nautilus. Should I ever know to what  nation belonged the strange man who boasted of belonging  to none ? This hatred which he had vowed to humanity  this hatred which perhaps sought terrible means of revenge,  what had provoked it ? Was he one of those misjudged  scientific men like the American Maury, whose career has  been broken by political revolutions ? I could not yet     76 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   say. I, whom hazard had just cast upon his vessel I,  whose life he held in his hands, he had received me coldly,  but with hospitality. Only he had never taken the hand  I had held out to him. He had never held out his to me.   For a whole hour I remained buried in these reflections,  seeking to pierce the mystery that interested me so greatly.  Then my eyes fell upon the vast planisphere on the table,  and I placed my finger on the very spot where the captain  told me we had descended.   The sea has its large rivers like continents. They are  special currents, known by their temperature and colour.  The most remarkable is known under the name of the  Gulf Stream. Science has found out the direction of five  principal currents one in the North Atlantic, a second  in the South Atlantic, a third in the North Pacific, a fourth  in the South Pacific, and a fifth in the South Indian Ocean.  It is probable that a sixth current formerly existed in the  North Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas,  united to the great Asiatic lakes, only formed one vast  sheet of water.   At the point on the planisphere where my ringer lay,  one of these currents was rolling the Kuro-Scivo or Black  River of the Japanese, which, leaving the Gulf of Bengal,  where the perpendicular rays of a tropical sun warm it,  crosses the Straits of Malacca, runs along the coast of  Asia, turns into the North Pacific as far as the Aleutian  Islands, carrying with it the trunks of camphor-trees and  other indigenous productions, contrasting by the pure  indigo of its warm waters with the waves of the ocean.  It was this current that the Nautilus was going to follow.  I saw that it lost itself in the immensity of the Pacific,  and felt myself carried along by it. Just then Ned Land  and Conseil appeared at the door of the saloon.   My two companions were petrified at the sight of the  marvels spread out before their eyes.    Where are we where are we ?  cried the Canadian.   At the Quebec Museum ?     If monsieur allows me to say so, replied Conseil,  ' it is more like the Hotel du Sommerard.    My friends, said I, making them a sign to enter,     UNDER THE SEA 77    you are neither in Canada nor France, but on board the  Nautilus, and at more than twenty-five fathoms below the  sea level.    We must believe what monsieur says, replied Conseil,   but really this saloon is enough to astonish even a Dutch-  man like me.    Marvel and look, Conseil, for there is enough for such a  good classifier as you to do here.   There was no need for me to encourage Conseil ; he  was at once absorbed in inspecting the surrounding objects.   During this time Ned Land, who was not so much in-  terested in what he immediately saw, questioned me about  my interview with Captain Nemo. Had I discovered who  he was, from whence he came, whither he was going, to  what depths he was dragging us ? in short, a thousand  questions, to which I had not time to answer.   I told him all I knew, or rather all I did not know, and  I asked him what he had heard or seen on his side.    I have seen nothing, heard nothing, answered the  Canadian.  I have not even seen the ship's crew. Can  it be electric too ?     Electric 1     Faith, any one would think so. But you, M. Aron-  nax, said Ned Land, who stuck to his idea,  can you tell  me how many men there are on board ? Are there ten,  twenty, fifty, a hundred ?     I know no more than you, Mr. Land ; it is better to  abandon at present all idea of either taking possession of  the Nautilus or escaping from it. This vessel is a master-  piece of modern industry, and I should regret not to have  seen it. Many people would accept our position only to  move amidst such marvels. The only thing to do is to  keep quiet and watch what passes around us.    Watch !  exclaimed the harpooner,  but there's  nothing to watch ; we can't see anything in this iron prison.  We are moving along blindfolded.   Ned Land had scarcely uttered these words when it be-  came suddenly dark. The light in the ceiling had gone out.   We remained mute and did not stir, not knowing what  awaited us. But a sliding noise was heard. It was as     78 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   if panek were being drawn back in the sides of the Nautilus.    It is the end of all things !  said Ned Land.   Suddenly light appeared on either side of the saloon,  through two oblong openings. The liquid mass appeared  vividly lighted up by the electric effluence.   Two crystal panes separated us from the sea. At first I  shuddered at the thought that this feeble partition might  break, but strong copper bands bound it, giving an almost  infinite power of resistance.   The sea was distinctly visible for a mile round the Nau-  tilus. What a spectacle ! Who could paint the effect  of the light through those transparent sheets of water,  and the softness of its successive gradations from the lower  to the upper beds of the ocean ?   The transparency of the sea is well known, and its lim-  pidity is far greater than that of fresh water. The mineral  and organic substances which it holds in suspension increase  its transparency. In certain parts of the ocean at the  Antilles, under seventy-five fathoms of water, the sandy  bottom can be seen with surprising clearness, and the  penetrating strength of the sun's rays only appears to stop  at a depth of 150 fathoms. But in this fluid medium  through which the Nautilus was travelling the electric light  was produced in the very bosom of the waves. It was not  luminous water, but liquid light.   The Nautilus did not seem to be moving. It was be-  cause there were no landmarks. Sometimes, however,  the lines of water, furrowed by her prow, flowed before our  eyes with excessive speed.   Lost in wonder we stood before these windows, and none  of us had broken this silence of astonishment when Conseil  said    Well, friend Ned, you wanted to look ; well, now you  see !     It is curious !  exclaimed the Canadian, who, forget-  ting his anger and projects of flight, was irresistibly  attracted.  Who wouldn't come for the sake of such a  sight ?     Now I understand the man's life, I exclaimed.  He  has made a world of marvels for himself ?     UNDER THE SEA 79   ' But I don't see any fish, said the Canadian.    What does it matter to you, friend Ned, answered  Conseil,  since you know nothing about them ?     I ! A fisherman !  cried Ned Land.   And thereupon a dispute arose between the two friends,  for each had some knowledge of fish, though in a very  different way.   Perhaps the Canadian knew as much as most men of  his particular calling, but Conseil knew much more, and  now that he had made friends with Ned, he could not allow  himself to seem less learned than he. He accordingly said  to him    Friend Ned, you are a killer of fish a very skilful  fisher. You have taken a great number of these interesting  animals. But I wager that you do not know how they  t\re classified.    Yes, I do, answered the harpooner seriously.  They  axe classified into fish that are good for food and fish that  are not.    That is a greedy distinction, answered Conseil.  But  do you know the difference between bony and cartilaginous  fish?    Perhaps I do, Conseil.    And the subdivision of these two grand classes ?     I dare say I do, answered the Canadian.    Well, friend Ned, listen and remember ! The bony  fish are subdivided into six orders. Primo, the acanthop-  terygii, of which the upper jaw is complete, mobile with  gills in the form of a comb. This order comprises fifteen  families that is to say, the three-fourths of known fish.  Type : the common perch.    Pretty good eating, answered Ned Land.    Secundo, continued Conseil,  the abdominals, an order  of fish whose ventral fins are placed behind the pectoral,  without being attached to the shoulder-bones an order  which is divided into five families, and comprises most  fresh-water fish. Type : the carp, roach, salmon, pike, etc.    Perch !  said the Canadian disdainfully ;  fresh-  water fish !     Tertio, said Conseil,  the subrachians, with ventral     8o TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   fins under the pectoral, and fastened to the shoulder-bones.  This order contains four families. Type : plaice, mud-fish,  turbots, brills, soles, etc.    Excellent ! excellent !  cried the harpooner, who  would only think of them from their eatable point of view.    Quarto, said Conseil, nowise confused,  the apodes  with long bodies and no ventral fins, covered with a thick  and often sticky skin an order that only comprises one  family. Type : the eel, wolf-fish, sword-fish, lance, etc.    Middling ! only middling !  answered Ned Land.    Quinto, said Conseil,  the lophiadae, distinguished by  the bones of the carpus being elongated, and forming a  kind of arm, which supports the pectoral fins. Type :  the angler, or fishing frog.    Bad ! bad !  replied the harpooner.    Sexto and lastly, said Conseil,  the plectognathes,  which include those which have the maxillary bones  anchylosed to the sides of the intermaxillaries, which alone  form the jaws an order which has no real ventral fins,  and is composed of two families. Type : the sun-fish.    Which any saucepan would be ashamed of !  cried  the Canadian.    Did you understand, friend Ned ?  asked the learned  Conseil.   Not the least in the world, friend Conseil, answered  the harpooner.  But go on, for you are very interesting.    As to the cartilaginous fish, continued the imperturb-  able Conseil,  they only include three orders.    So much the better, said Ned.    Primo, the cyclostomes, with circular mouths and  gills opening by numerous holes an order including only  one family. Type : the lamprey.    You must get used to it to like it, answered Ned Land.    Secundo, the selachii, with gills like the cyclostomes, but  whose lower jaw is mobile. This order, which is the most  important of the class, includes two families. Types :  sharks and rays.    What !  cried Ned ;  rays and sharks in the same  order ? Well, friend Conseil, I should not advise you to put  them in the same jar.     UNDER THE SEA 81    Tertio, answered Conseil,  the sturiones, with gills  opened as usual by a single slit, furnished with an operacu-  lum an order which includes four genera. Type : the  sturgeon.    Well, friend Conseil, you have kept the best for the  last, in my opinion, at least. Is that all ?     Yes, Ned, answered Conseil ;  and remark that even  when you know that you know nothing, for the families  are subdivided into genera, sub-genera, species, varieties.    Well, friend Conseil, said the harpooner, leaning  against the glass of the panel,  there are some varieties  passing now.    Yes ! some fish, cried Conseil.  It is like being at  an aquarium.    No, I answered,  for an aquarium is only a cage,  and those fish are as free as birds in the air.    Well, now, Conseil, tell me their names ! tell me their  names !  said Ned Land.    I ?  answered Conseil ;  I could not do it ; that is  my master's business.   And, in fact, the worthy fellow, though an enthusiastic  classifier, was not a naturalist. The Canadian, on the  contrary, named them all without hesitation.   Decidedly, between them, Ned Land and Conseil would  have made a distinguished naturalist.   For two hours a whole aquatic army escorted the Nautilus.  Amidst their games and gambols, whilst they rivalled each  other in brilliancy and speed, I recognised the green wrasse,  the surmullet, marked with a double black stripe ; the  goby, with its round tail, white with violet spots ; the  Japanese mackerel, with blue body and silver head ; bril-  liant, the azure fish, the name of which beggars all descrip-  tion, gilt heads with a black band down their tails ; aulos-  tones with flute-like noses, real sea- woodcocks, of which  some specimens attain a yard in length ; Japanese salaman-  ders ; sea-eels, serpents six feet long with bright little  eyes and a huge mouth bristling with teeth, etc.   My admiration was excited to the highest pitch. It had  never been my lot to see these animals living and free in  their natural element. I shall not cite all the varieties that     82 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   passed before our dazzled eyes, all that collection from the  Japanese and Chinese seas. More numerous than the birds  of the air, these fish swam round us, doubtless attracted by  the electric light.   Suddenly light again appeared in the saloon. The iron  panels were again closed. The enchanting vision disap-  peared. But long after that I was dreaming still, until my  eyes happened to fall on the instruments hung on the  partition. The compass still indicated the direction of  N.N.E., the manometer indicated a pressure of five atmo-  spheres, corresponding to a depth of 100 fathoms, and the  electric log gave a speed of 15 miles an hour.   I expected Captain Nemo, but he did not appear. The  clock was on the stroke of five. Ned Land and Conseil  returned to their cabin, and I regained my room.   I passed the evening reading, writing, and thinking.  Then sleep overpowered me, and I stretched myself on my  couch and slept profoundly, whilst the Nautilus glided  rapidly along the current of the Black River.   CHAPTER XV   A WRITTEN INVITATION   THE next day, the gth of November, I awoke after a sleep  that had lasted twelve hours. Conseil came, as was his  custom, to ask  how monsieur had passed the night,  and to offer his services. He had left his friend the Cana-  dian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else  in his life.   I let the brave fellow chatter on in his own fashion, with-  out troubling to answer him much. I was anxious about  the absence of Captain Nemo during our spectacle of the  evening before, and hoped to see him again that day.   I was soon clothed in my fibre-like garments. Their  nature provoked many reflections from Conseil. I told  him they were manufactured with the lustrous and silky  filaments which fasten a sort of shell to the rocks. For-  merly beautiful materials stockings and gloves were  made from it, and they were both very soft and very warm.  The crew of the Nautilus could, therefore, be clothed at a     UNDER THE SEA 83   cheap rate, without help of either cotton-trees, sheep, or  silkworms of the earth.   When I was dressed I went into the saloon. It was  deserted.   I plunged into the study of the conchological treasures  piled up in the cases. The whole day passed without my  being honoured with a visit from Captain Nemo. The  panels of the saloon were not opened. Perhaps they did  not wish us to get tired of such beautiful things.   The direction of the Nautilus kept N.N.E., its speed at  twelve miles, its depth between twenty-five and thirty  fathoms.   The next day, the loth of November, the same desertion,  the same solitude. I did not see one of the ship's crew.  Ned and Conseil passed the greater part of the day with me.  They were astonished at the inexplicable absence of the  captain.   After all, as Conseil said, we enjoyed complete liberty ;  we were delicately and abundantly fed. Our host kept to  the terms of his treaty.   That day I began the account of these adventures, which  allowed me to relate them with the most scrupulous exact-  ness, and, curious detail, I wrote it on paper made with  marine zostera. >   Early in the morning of November nth, the fresh air  spread over the interior of the Nautilus told me that we were  again on the surface of the ocean to renew our supply of  oxygen. I went to the central staircase and ascended it to  the platform. It was 6 a.m. The weather was cloudy, the  sea grey, but calm. There was scarcely any swell. I hoped  to meet Captain Nemo there. Would he come ? I only  saw the helmsman in his glass cage. Seated on the upper  portion of the hull, I drank in the sea-breeze with delight.   Little by little the clouds disappeared under the action of  the sun's rays. I was admiring this joyful suniise, so gay  and reviving, when I heard some one coming up to the  platform. I prepared to address Captain Nemo, but it  was his mate whom I had already seen during the captain's  first visit who appeared. He did not seem to perceive my  presence, and with his powerful glass he swept the horizon,   F     84 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   after which he approached the stair-head and called out  some words which I reproduce exactly, for every morning  they were uttered under the same conditions. They were  the following :    Nautron respoc lorni virch.   What those words meant I know not.   The mate then went below again, and I supposed that  the Nautilus was going to continue her submarine course,  so I followed him and regained my room.   Five days passed and altered nothing in our position.  Each morning I ascended to the platform. The same sen-  tence was pronounced by the same individual. Captain  Nemo did not appear.   I had made up my mind that I was not going to see him  again, when on the i6th of November, on entering my  room with Ned Land and Conseil, I found a note directed  to me upon the table.   I opened it agitatedly. It was written in a bold, clear  hand, and ran as follows :    To Professor ARONNAX,    November i6th, 1867.    Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax to a hunt which  will take place to-morrow morning in the forest of the island  of Crespo. He hopes nothing will prevent the professor  joining it, and he will have much pleasure in seeing his  companions also.    The Commander of the Nautilus.    CAPTAIN NEMO.   ' A hunt I  cried Ned.   ' And in the forests of Crespo Island, added Conseil.   ' Then that fellow does land sometimes, said Ned Land.   ' It looks like it, said I, reading the letter again.   ' Well, we must accept, replied the Canadian.  Once  on land we can decide what to do. Besides, I shall not be  sorry to eat some fresh meat.   I consulted the planisphere as to the whereabouts of the  island of Crespo, and in 32 40' north lat. and 167 50' west  long. I found a small island which was reconnoitred in  1801 by Captain Crespo, and which was marked in old     UNDER THE SEA 85   Spanish maps as Rocca de la Plata, or  Silver Rock.  We were then about 1,800 miles from our starting-point,  and the course of the Nautilus, a little changed, was bring-  ing it back towards the south-east. I pointed out to my  companions the little rock lost in the midst of the North  Pacific.    If Captain Nemo does land sometimes, I said,  he  at least chooses quite desert islands.   Ned Land shrugged his shoulders without speaking, and  he and Conseil left me. After supper, which was served  by the mute and impassible steward, I went to bed, not  without some anxiety.   The next day, November I7th, when I awoke, I felt that  the Nautilus was perfectly still. I dressed quickly and  went to the saloon.   Captain Nemo was there waiting for me. He rose, bowed,  and asked me if it was convenient for me to accompany him.   As he made no allusion to his eight days' absence I  abstained from speaking of it, and answered simply that  my companions and I were ready to follow him.    May I ask you, captain, I said,  how it is that, having  broken all ties with earth, you possess forests in Crespo  Island ?     Professor, answered the captain,  my forests are not  terrestrial forests but submarine forests.   ' Submarine forests 1  I exclaimed.   ' Yes, professor.   ' And you offer to take me to them ?    ' Precisely.   ' On foot ?    ' Yes, and dryfooted too.   ' But how shall we hunt ? with a gun ?    ' Yes, with a gun.   I thought the captain was gone mad, and the idea was  expressed on my face, but he only invited me to follow  him like a man resigned to anything. We entered the  dining-room, where breakfast was laid.    M. Aronnax, said the captain,  will you share my  breakfast without ceremony ? We will talk as we eat. You  will not find a restaurant in our walk though you will a     86 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   forest. Breakfast like a man who will probably dine very  late.   I did justice to the meal, and following the captain's  example, I washed it down with sparkling water, which was  diluted by a few drops of some fermented liquor, extracted  from a sea-weed. Captain Nemo went on eating at first  without saying a word. Then he said to me    When I invited you to hunt in my submarine forests,  professor, you thought I was mad. You judged me too  lightly. You know as well as I do that man can live under  water, providing he takes with him a provision of air to  breathe. When submarine work has to be done, the work-  man, clad in a water-tight dress, with his head in a metal  helmet, receives air from above by means of pumps and  regulators.    Then it is a diving apparatus ?     Yes, but one that enables him to get rid of the india-  rubber tube attached to the pump. It is an apparatus,  invented by two of your own countrymen, but which  I have brought to perfection for my own use, and which  will allow you to risk yourself in the water without suffer-  ing. It is composed of a reservoir of thick iron plates, in  which I store the air under a pressure of fifty atmospheres.  This reservoir is fastened on to the back by means of braces,  like a soldier's knapsack ; its upper part forms a box, in  which the air is kept by means of bellows, and which cannot  escape except at its normal tension. Two indiarubber pipes  leave this box and join a sort of tent, which imprisons the  nose and mouth ; one introduces fresh air, the other lets out  foul, and the tongue closes either according to the needs of  respiration. But I, who encounter great pressure at the  bottom of the sea, am obliged to shut my head in a globe of  copper, into which the two pipes open.    Perfectly, Captain Nemo ; but the air that you carry  with you must soon be used up, for as soon as it only con-  tains fifteen per cent, of oxygen, it is no longer fit to  breathe.    I have already told you, M. Aronnax, that the pumps  of the Nautilus allow me to store up air under considerable  pressure, and under these conditions the reservoir of the     UNDER THE SEA 87   apparatus can furnish breathable air for nine or ten hours.    I have no other objection to make, I answered.  I  will only ask you one thing, captain. How do you light  your road at the bottom of the ocean ?     With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax. It is  composed of a Bunsen pile, which I do not work with bichro-  mate of potassium, but with sodium. A wire is introduced,  which collects the electricity produced, and directs it ten-  wards a particularly-made lantern. In this lantern is a  spiral glass which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas.  When the apparatus is at work the gas becomes luminous,  and gives out a white and continuous light. Thus provided,  I breathe and see.    But, Captain Nemo, what sort of a gun do you use ?    It is not a gun for powder, but an air-gun. How could  I manufacture gunpowder on board without either salt-  petre, sulphur, or charcoal ?     Besides, I added,  to fire under water in a medium  855 times denser than air, very considerable resistance  would have to be conquered.   That would be no difficulty. There exist certain  Felton guns, perfected in England by Philip Coles and  Burley, by the Frenchman Furcy and the Italian Landi,  furnished with a peculiar system of closing, which can be  fired under these conditions. But, I repeat, having no  powder, I use air under great pressure, which the pumps  of the Naiitilus furnish abundantly.    But this air must be rapidly consumed.    Well, have I not my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can  furnish me with what I need ? All I want for that is a  tap ad hoc. Besides, you will see for yourself, M. Aronnax,  that during these submarine shooting excursions you do  not use either much air or bullets.    But it seems to me that in the half-light, and amidst a  liquid so much more dense than the atmosphere, bodies  cannot be projected far, and are not easily mortal.    Sir, with these guns every shot is mortal, and as soon as  the animal is touched, however slightly, it falls crushed.    Why ?     Because they are not ordinary .bullets. We use little     88 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   glass percussion-caps, covered with steel, and weighted with  a leaden bottom. They are really little bottles, in which  electricity is forced to a very high tension. At the slightest  shock they go off, and the animal, however powerful it  may be, falls dead.    I will argue no longer, I replied, rising from the table.   The only thing left me is to take my gun. Besides, where  you go I will follow.   Captain Nemo then led me aft of the Nautilus and whilst  passing the cabin of Ned Conseil, I called my two com-  panions, who followed me immediately. Then we came to  a cell, situated near the engine-room, in which we were to  put on our walking dress.   CHAPTER XVI   AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA   THIS cell was, properly speaking, the arsenal and wardrobe  of the Nautilus. A dozen diving apparatus, hung from  the wall, awaited our use.   Ned Land, seeing them, was disinclined to put one on.    But, my worthy Ned, I said,  the forests of Crespo,  Island are only submarine forests !    The disappointed harpooner saw his dreams of fresh meat  fade away.    And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to put on one of  those things ?     I must, Master Ned.    You can do as you please, sir, replied the harpooner,  shrugging his shoulders,  but as for me, unless I am forced,  I will never get into one.    No one will force you, Ned, said Captain Nemo.    Does Conseil mean to risk it ?  said Ned.    I shall follow monsieur wherever he goes, answered  Conseil.   Two of the ship's crew came to help us on the call of the  captain and we donned the cumbersome clothes made of  seamless indiarubber, and constructed expressly to resist  considerable pressure. They looked like suits of armour,  both supple and resisting, and formed trousers and coat ;     UNDER THE SEA 89   the trousers were finished off with thick boots, which were  weighted with leaden soles. The texture of the coat was  held together by bands of copper, which crossed the chest,  protecting it from the pressure of the water, and leaving  the lungs free to act ; the sleeves ended in the form of supple  gloves, which in no way restrained the movements of the  hands.   Captain Nemo and one of his companions a sort of  Hercules Conseil, and myself, were soon enveloped in  these submarine outfits. There was nothing left but to  put our heads into the metallic globes. But before pro-  ceeding with this operation I asked the captain's permission  to examine the guns we were to take.   One of the crew gave me a simple gun, the butt-end of  which, made of steel and hollowed in the interior, was rather  large ; it served as a reservoir for compressed air, which a  valve, worked by a spring, allowed to escape into a metal  tube. A box of projectiles, fixed in a groove in the thick-  ness of the butt-end, contained about twenty electric  bullets, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the  barrel of the gun. As soon as one shot was fired another  was ready.   Captain Nemo, said I, this works automatically;  all I ask now is to try it. But how shall we gain the bottom  of the sea ?     At this moment, professor, the Nautilus is stranded  in five fathoms of water, and we have only to start.   But how shall we get out ?    You will soon see.   Captain Nemo put on his helmet. Conseil and I did the  same, not without hearing an ironical  Good sport  from  the Canadian. The upper part of our coat was surmounted  by a copper collar, upon which the metal helmet was  screwed. As soon as it was in position the apparatus on  our backs began to act, and, for my part, I could breathe  with ease.   I found when I was ready, lamp and all, that I could  not move a step. But this was foreseen. I felt myself  pushed along a little room adjoining the wardrobe-room.  My companions, pushed along in the same way, followed     90 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   me. I heard an air-tight door close behind us, and we were  in profound darkness.   After some minutes I heard a loud whistling, and felt the  cold mount from my feet to my chest. It was evident that  they had filled the room in which we were with sea- water,  by means of a tap. A second door in the side of the  Nautilus opened then. A faint light appeared. A moment  after, our feet were treading the bottom of the sea.   And now, how could I describe the impression made upon  me by that walk under the sea ? Marvellous ! When the  brush itself is powerless to depict the particular effects of  the liquid element, how can the pen reproduce them ?   Captain Nemo walked on in front, and his companion  followed us some steps behind. Conseil and I remained  near one another, as if any exchange of words had been  possible through our metallic covering. I no longer felt  the weight of my clothes, shoes, air-reservoir, nor of that  thick globe in the midst of which my head shook like an  almond in its shell.   The light which illuminated the ground at thirty feet  below the surface of the ocean astonished me by its power.  The solar rays easily pierced this watery mass and dissipated  its colour. One easily distinguished objects 120 yards off.  The water around me only appeared a sort of air, denser  than the terrestrial atmosphere, but nearly as transparent.  Above me I perceived the calm surface of the sea.   We were walking on fine even sand, not wave-like, as it  is on a flat shore which keeps the imprint of the billows.  This dazzling carpet reflected the rays of the sun with sur-  prising intensity. Shall I be believed when I affirm that  at that depth of thirty feet I saw as well as in open daylight?   For a quarter of an hour I trod on this shining sand.  The hull of the Nautilus, looking like a long rock, disap-  peared by degrees ; but its lantern, when night came,  would facilitate our return on board. I put back with my  hands the liquid curtains which closed again behind me, and  saw my foot -prints soon effaced by the pressure of the water.   I soon came to some magnificent rocks, carpeted with  splendid corals.   It was then 10 a.m. The ravs of the sun struck the     UNDER THE SEA 91   surface of the waves at an oblique angle, and at their con-  tact with the light, composed by a refraction as through a  prism, flowers, rocks, plants, and polypi were shaded at  their edges by the seven solar colours ; it was a grand feast  for the eyes this complication of tints, a veritable kaleido-  scope of green, yellow, orange, violet, indigo, and blue in a  word, all the palette of an enthusiastic colourist.   After a brief halt to gaze on this splendid spectacle, and  proceeding, within the space of a quarter of a mile, we  saw an unbroken scene formed by the wondrous products  of the mighty ocean. I noticed that the green plants kept  near the surface, whilst the red occupied a middle depth,  leaving to the black or brown hydrophytes the care of  forming gardens and flower-beds in the remote depths of  the ocean. The family of seaweeds produces the largest  and smallest vegetables of the globe.   We had left the Nautilus about an hour and a-hatf . It  was nearly twelve o'clock ; I knew that by the perpendicu-  larity of the sun's rays, which were no longer refracted.  The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the emerald  and sapphire tints died out. We marched along with a  regular step which rang upon the ground with astonishing  intensity ; the slightest sound is transmitted with a speed  to which the ear is not accustomed on the earth in fact,  water is a better conductor of sound than air in the ratio of  four to one.   The ground gradually sloped downwards, and the light  took a uniform tint. We were at a depth of more than a  hundred yards, and bearing a pressure of ten atmospheres.  But my diving apparatus was so small that I suffered no-  thing from this pressure. I merely felt a slight discomfort  in my finger- joints, and even that soon disappeared. As  to the fatigue that this walk in such unusual harness might  be expected to produce, it was nothing. My movements,  helped by the water, were made with surprising facility.   I could still see the rays of the sun, but feebly. To their  intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, middle  term between day and night. Still we saw sufficiently to  guide ourselves, and it was not yet necessary to light our  lamps.     92 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   At that moment Captain Nemo stopped. He waited for  me to come up to him, and with his finger pointed to some  obscure masses which stood out of the shade at some little  distance.    It is the forest of Crespo Island, I thought, and I was  not mistaken   CHAPTER XVII   AFOOT ON THE SEA BED   WE had at last arrived on the borders of this forest, doubt-  less one of the most beautiful in the immense domain  of Captain Nemo. He looked upon it as his own, and  who was there to dispute his right ? This forest was  composed of arborescent plants, and as soon as we had  penetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck at first by  the singular disposition of their branches.   None of those herbs which carpeted the ground none of  the branches of the larger plants, were either bent, drooped,  or extended horizontally. There was not a single filament,  however thin, that did not keep as upright as a rod of iron.  When I bent them with my hand these plants immediately  resumed their first position. It was the reign of perpendicu-  larity.   I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic disposition  of things, as well as to the relative obscurity which enveloped  us.   I noticed that all these productions of the vegetable  kingdom had no roots, and only held on to either sand,  shell, or rock. These plants drew no vitality from anything  but the water. The greater number, instead of leaves, shot  forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised within a scale  of colours pink, carmine, red, olive, fawn, and brown.    Curious anomaly, fantastic element, said an ingenious  naturalist.  Where the animal kingdom blossoms the  vegetable does not.   Amongst these different shrubs, as large as the trees  of temperate zones, and under their humid shade, were  massed veritable bushes of living flowers, hedges, grassy  tufts, and, to complete the illusion, the fish-flies flew from  branch to branch like a swarm of humming-birds.     UNDER THE SEA 93   About one o'clock Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt.  I, for my part, was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves  under a thicket of alariae, the long thin blades of which  shot up like arrows.   This short rest seemed delicious to me. Nothing was  wanting but the charm of conversation, but it was im-  possible to speak I could only approach my large copper  head to that of Conseil. I saw the eyes of the worthy  fellow shine with contentment, and he moved about in his  covering in the most comical way in the world.   After this four hours' walk I was much astonished not to  find myself violently hungry, and I cannot tell why, but  instead I was intolerably sleepy, as all divers are. My eyes  closed behind their thick glass, and I fell into an unavoid-  able slumber, which the movement of walking had alone  prevented up till then. Captain Nemo and his robust  companion, lying down in the clear crystal, set us the  example.   How long I remained asleep I cannot tell, but when I  awoke the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon. Cap-  tain Nemo was already on his feet, and I was stretching  myself when an unexpected apparition brought me quickly  to my feet.   A few steps off an enormous sea-spider, more than a yard  high, was looking at me with his squinting eyes ready to  spring upon me. Although my dress was thick enough  to defend me against the bite of this animal, I could not  restrain a movement of horror. Conseil and the sailor of  the Nautilus awoke at that moment. A blow from the butt-  end of Captain Nemo's gun killed it, and I saw its terrible  claws writhe in horrible convulsions.   This incident reminded me that other animals, more to be  feared, might haunt these obscure depths, and that my  diver's dress would not protect me against their attacks.  I had not thought of that before, and resolved to be on my  guard. I supposed that this halt marked the limit of our  excursion, but I was mistaken, and instead of returning to  the Nautilus, Captain Nemo went on.   The ground still inclined and took us to greater depths.  It must have been about three o'clock when we reached a     94 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   narrow valley between two high cliffs, situated about  seventy-five fathoms deep. Thanks to the perfection of  our apparatus, we were forty-five fathoms below the limit  which Nature seems to have imposed on the submarine  excursions of man.   I knew how deep we were because the obscurity became  so profound not an object was visible at ten paces. I  walked along groping when I suddenly saw a white light  shine out. Captain Nemo had just lighted his electric  lamp. His companion imitated him. Conseil and I fol-  lowed their example. By turning a screw I established the  communication between the spool and the glass serpentine,  and the sea, lighted up by our four lanterns, was illumin-  ated in a radius of twenty-five yards.   Captain Nemo still kept on plunging into the dark depths  of the forest, the trees of which were getting rarer and rarer.  I remarked that the vegetable life disappeared sooner than  the animal. The medusae had already left the soil, which  had become arid, whilst a prodigious number of animals,  zoophytes, articulata, molluscs, and fish swarmed there still.   As we walked I thought that the light of our Ruhmkorff  apparatus could not fail to draw some inhabitants from  these sombre depths. But if they did approach us they at  least kept a respectful distance from us. Several times I  saw Captain Nemo stop and take aim ; then, after some  minutes' observation, he rose and went on walking.   At last, about four o'clock, this wonderful excursion  was ended. A wall of superb rocks rose up before us,  enormous granite cliffs impossible to climb. It was the  island of Crespo. Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. We  stopped at a sign from him. Here ended the domains of  the captain.   The return began. Captain Nemo again kept at the  head of his little band, and directed his steps without hesi-  tation. I thought I perceived that we were not returning  to the Nautilus by the road we had come. This new one  was very steep, and consequently very painful. We ap-  proached the surface of the sea rapidly. But this return  to the upper beds was not so sudden as to produce the internal  injuries so fatal to divers. Very soon light reappeared and     UNDER THE SEA 95   increased, and as the sun was already low on the horizon  refraction edged the different objects with a spectral ring.   At a depth of ten yards we were walking in a swarm of  little fish of every sort, more numerous than birds in the  air, and more agile too. But no aquatic game worthy of a  shot had as yet met our gaze.   At that moment I saw the captain put his gun to his  shoulder and follow a moving object into the shrubs. He  fired, I heard a feeble hissing, and an animal fell a few steps  from us.   It was a magnificent sea-otter, the only quadruped which  is exclusively marine. This otter was five feet long, and  must have been very valuable. Its skin, chestnut brown  above and silvery underneath, would have made one ol  those beautiful furs so sought after in the Russian and  Chinese markets ; the fineness and lustre of its coat was cer-  tainly worth at least eighty pounds. I admired this curious  mammal its rounded head and short ears, round eyes and  white whiskers, like those of a cat, with webbed feet and  claws and tufted tail. Captain Nemo's companion took it  up and threw it over his shoulders, and we continued our  route.   During the next hour a plain of sand lay stretched before  us. Sometimes it rose within two yards and some inches  of the surface of the water. I then saw the reflection of our  images above us, like us in every point, except that they  walked with their heads downwards and their feet in the air   The waves above us looked like clouds above our heads-  clouds which were no sooner formed than they vanished  rapidly. I even perceived the shadows of the large birds as  they floated on the surface of the water.   On this occasion I was witness to one of the finest gun-  shots which ever made a hunter's nerve thrill. A large  bird, with great breadth of wing, hovered over us. Captain  Nemo's companion shouldered his gun and fired when it  was only a few yards above the waves. The bird fell dead,  and the fall brought it in reach of the skilful hunter's grasp.  It was an albatross of the finest kind.   Our march was not interrupted by this incident. I was  worn out by fatigue when we at last perceived a faint light     96 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   half a mile off. Before twenty minutes were over we should  be on board and able to breathe with ease, for it seemed to  me that my reservoir of air was getting very deficient in  oxygen, but I did not reckon upon a meeting which delayed  our arrival.   I was about twenty steps behind Captain Nemo when he  suddenly turned towards me. With his vigorous hand he  threw me to the ground, whilst his companion did the same  to Conseil. At first I did not know what to think of this  sudden attack, but I was reassured when I saw that the  captain lay down beside me and remained perfectly motion-  less.   I was stretched on the ground just under the shelter of a  bush of algse, when, on raising my head, I perceived enor-  mous masses throwing phosphorescent gleams pass bluster-  ingly by.   My blood froze in my veins. I saw two formidable dog-  fish threatening us ; they were terrible creatures, with enor-  mous tails and a dull and glassy stare, who threw out phos-  phorescent beams from holes pierced round their muzzles.  Monstrous brutes which would crush a whole man in their  jaws ! I do not know if Conseil stayed to classify them.  For my part, I noticed their silver stomachs and their  formidable mouths bristling with teeth from a very unscien-  tific point of view more as a possible victim than as a  naturalist.   Happily, these voracious animals see badly. They  passed without perceiving us, brushing us with their brown-  ish fins, and we escaped, as if by a miracle, this danger,  certainly greater than the meeting of a tiger in a forest.   Half an hour after, guided by the electric light, we reached  the Nautilus. The outside door had remained open, and  Captain Nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first  cell. Then he pressed a knob. I heard the pumps worked  inside the vessel. I felt the water lower around me, and in a  few moments the cell was entirely empty. The inner door  then opened, and we entered the wardrobe-room.   There our diving dresses were taken off, and, quite worn  out from want of food and sleep, I returned to my room,  lost in wonder at this surprising excursion under the sea.     UNDER THE SEA 97   CHAPTER XVIII   UNDER THE PACIFIC   THE next morning, the i8th of November, I was perfectly  recovered from my fatigue of the day before, and I went  up on to the platform at the very moment that the mate  was pronouncing his daily sentence. It then came into my  mind that it had to do with the state of the sea, and that  it signified  There is nothing in sight.   And, in fact, the ocean was quite clear. There was not a  sail on the horizon. The heights of Crespo Island had dis-  appeared during the night. The sea, absorbing the colours  of the solar prism, with the exception of the blue rays,  reflected them in every direction, and was of an admirable  indigo shade. A large wave was regularly undulating its  surface.   I was admiring this magnificent aspect of the sea when  Captain Nemo appeared. He did not seem to notice my  presence, and began a series of astronomical observations.  Then, when he had ended his operation, he went and leaned  against the cage of the watch-light and watched the surface  of the ocean.   In the meantime about twenty sailors from the Nautilus,  strong and well-built men, ascended upon the platform.  They came to draw in the nets which had been out all  night. These sailors evidently belonged to different nations,  although they were all of the European type. They spoke  very little, and only used the strange idiom of which I  could not even guess the origin, so that I could not question  them.   The nets were hauled in. They had, I estimated, captured  more than nine hundredweight of fish, which included many  curious specimens. We should not want for food.   These different products of the sea were immediately  lowered down by the panel leading to the storerooms, some  to be eaten fresh, others to be preserved.   The fishing ended and the provision of air renewed, I  thought that the Nautilus was going to continue its sub-  marine excursion, and I was preparing to return to my     98 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   room, when, without further preamble, the captain turned  to me and said    Is not the ocean gifted with real life, professor ? It is  sometimes gentle, at other times tempestuous. Yesterday  it slept as we did, and now it has awaked after a peaceful  night.   Neither  Good morning  nor  Good evening !  It  was as though this strange personage had been in conver-  sation with me all the time.    See now, he said,  it wakes under the sun's influence.  It will now renew its diurnal existence. It is deeply inter-  esting to watch the play of its organisation. It possesses a  pulse and arteries, it has its spasms, and I agree with the  learned Maury who discovered in it a circulation as real as  the circulation of blood in animals.   It was certain that Captain Nemo expected no answer  from me, and it appeared to me useless to keep saying   Evidently, or  You are right, or  It must be so.  He spoke rather to himself, taking some time between each  sentence. It was a meditation aloud.    Yes, said he,  the ocean possesses a veritable circu-  lation, and in order to cause it, it sufficed the Creator of all  things to multiply in it caloric, salt, and animalculae. You  will see at the poles the consequences of this phenomenon,  and you will understand why, according to the law of  provident Nature, freezing can never take place except  on the surface of the water !    Whilst Captain Nemo was finishing his sentence I said  to myself,  The Pole ! Does the daring man intend to  take us as far as there ?    In the-Vneantime the captain had stopped talking, and was  contemplating the element he so incessantly studied. Then  he resumed.    The salts, said he,  exist in a considerable quantity  in the sea, professor, and if you were to take out all it con-  tains in solution, you would make a mass of four million  and a half square miles, which, spread over the globe  would form a layer more than ten yards deep. And do  not think that the presence of this salt is due to a caprice of  Nature. No. It makes sea- water less capable of evapora-     UNDER THE SEA 99   tion, and prevents the wind taking off too great a quantity  of vapour, which, when it condenses, would submerge the  temperate zones. It has a great balancing part to play  in the general economy of the globe !    Captain Nemo stopped, rose, took several steps on the  platform, and came back towards me.    As to the infusoria, as to the hundreds of millions of  animalculae which exist by millions in a drop of water, and  of which it takes 800,000 to weigh a milligramme, their part  is not less important. They absorb the marine salts, they  assimilate the solid elements of water, and, veritable manu-  facturers of calcareous continents, they make coral and  madrepores, and then the drop of water deprived of its  mineral element is lightened, mounts to the surface, absorbs  there the salt left by evaporation, is weighted, sinks again,  and takes back to the animalcules new elements to absorb.  Hence a double current, ascending and descending, always  movement and life life more intense than that of conti-  nents, more exuberant, more infinite, flourishing in every  part of this ocean, element of death to man, they say,  element of life to myriads of animals, and to me !    When Captain Nemo spoke thus he was transfigured, and  evoked in me extraordinary emotion.    True existence is there, added he,  and I could con-  ceive the foundation of nautical towns, agglomeration of  submarine houses, which, like the Nautilus would go up  every morning to breathe on the surface of the water free  towns, if ever there were any, independent cities ! And  yet who knows if some despot    Captain Nemo finished his sentence by a violent gesture.  Then, addressing himself directly to me as if to drive away  some gloomy thought, he said    M. Aronnax, do you know how deep the ocean is ?     I know at least, captain, what the principal soundings  have taught us.    Could you repeat them to me, so that I might counter-  register them if necessary ?     Here are some that occur to me, I answered.  If I  am not mistaken they have found an average depth of  8,200 metres in the North Atlantic, and 2,500 metres in   G     loo TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   the Mediterranean. The most remarkable soundings have  been taken in the South Atlantic, near the 35th degree ;  and they have given 1,200 metres, 14,081 metres, and  15,149 metres in short, it is estimated that if the bottom  of the sea was levelled its average depth would be about  five miles.    Well, professor, answered Captain Nemo,  we shall  show you better than that, I hope. As to the average  depth of this part of the Pacific, I can tell you that it is  only 4,000 metres.   That said, Captain Nemo went towards the panel and  disappeared. I also descended, going into ' he saloon. The  screw then began to work, and the log gave twenty miles  an hour.   For days and weeks Captain Nemo was very sparing of  his visits. I only saw him at rare intervals.   Conseil and Land passed long hours with me. Conseil  had related to his friend the marvels of our excursion, and  the Canadian regretted not having accompanied us.   For several hours each day, the panels of the saloon  were open, and our eyes feasted on the mysteries of the  submarine world.   The Nautilus kept a north-easterly direction. It crossed  the equator on December ist by long. 142, and the 4th of  the same month, after a rapid passage during which no  particular incident happened, we sighted the group of the  Marquesas. I perceived, at a distance of three miles, the  wooded mountains outlined on the horizon, for Captain  Nemo did not like to draw near any land. There the nets  brought in some fine specimens of fish for the pantry.   After leaving these islands, from the 4th to the nth of  December the Nautilus sailed over 2,000 miles. This  navigation was marked by the meeting of an immense shoal  of molluscs. They could be counted by millions. They  were emigrating from the temperate to the warmer zones,  following the track of herrings and sardines. We watched  them through the crystal panes, swimming backwards with  extreme rapidity, moving by means of their locomotive  tube, pursuing fish and molluscs, eating the little ones, eaten  by the big ones, and agitating, in indescribable confusion.     UNDER THE SEA IQJ   the ten arms that Nature had placed on their heads, like a  crest of pneumatic serpents. The Nautilus, notwithstand-  ing its speed, sailed for several hours in the midst of these  animals, and its net drew in an innumerable quantity.   It will be seen that during this voyage the sea provided  an amazing variety of its most marvellous spectacles. It  varied them infinitely. It changed its scenes and group-  ing for the pleasure of our eyes, and we were called upon,  not only to contemplate the works of the Creator amidst  the liquid element, but to penetrate as well into the most  fearful mysteries of the ocean.   During the day of the nth of December I was reading  in the saloon. Ned Land and Conseil were looking at the  luminous water through the half-open panels. The Nauti-  lus was stationary ; it was at a depth of 1,000 yards, a  region in which large fish alone make rare appearances.  Whilst engaged in reading a book Conseil interrupted me.    Will monsieur come here for a moment ?  said he in a  singular voice.   I rose, went to the window, and looked out. Full in the  electric light an enormous black mass, immovable, was  suspended in the midst of the waters. I looked at it atten-  tively, trying to make out the nature of this gigantic ceta-  cean. But an idea suddenly came into my mind.    A vessel !  I cried.    Yes, replied the Canadian,  a disabled ship sunk per-  pendicularly.   Ned Land was right. We were close to a vessel of which  the tattered shrouds still hung from their chains. The hull  seemed to be in good order, and it could not have been  wrecked more than a few hours ; the vessel had had to  sacrifice its mast. It lay on its side, had filled, and was  heeling over to port. This skeleton of what it had once  been was a sad spectacle under the waves, but sadden-still  was the sight of the deck, where corpses, bound with rope,  were still lying. I counted five ; one man was at the helm,  and a woman, apparently young, stood by the poop holding  an infant in her arms. I could clearly see her features by  the light of the Nautilus features which the water had not  yet decomposed. In a last effort she had raised the child     102 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   above her head, and the arms of the little one were round  its mother's neck. The sailors looked frightful, and seemed  to be making a last effort to free themselves from the cords  that bound them to the vessel. The helmsman alone, calm,  with a clear, grave face and iron-grey hair, was clutching  the wheel of the helm, and seemed, even then, to be guiding  the vessel through the depths of the ocean !   What a scene ! It struck us dumb, and as we were turn-  ing away we saw, advancing towards it with hungry eyes,  enormous sharks attracted by the human flesh !   The Nautilus just then turned round the submerged  vessel, and I read on the stern  Florida, Sunderland.     CHAPTER XIX   A CONTINENT IN THE MAKING   THIS terrible spectacle inaugurated the series of catastro-  phes which the Nautilus was to meet with on her route.  Since it had been in more frequented seas we often per-  ceived the hulls of ships wrecked vessels which were rot-  ting in the midst of the waters, and, deeper down, cannons,  bullets, anchors, chains, and other iron objects which were  being eaten up by the rust.   We lived in the Nautilus our usual isolated lives, and  on the nth of December we sighted the archipelago of  Pomotou. These islands are of coral formation. They  slowly but continuously rise by the work of the polypi,  which will one day join them together. Then this new  island will be joined to the neighbouring archipelagoes, and  a fifth continent will stretch from New Zealand and New  Caledonia to the Marquesas.   The day that I developed this theory before Captain  Nemo he answered me coldly    The earth does not want new continents, but new  men !    The hazards of its navigation had precisely conducted  the Nautilus towards the island of Clermont-Tonnerre, one  of the most curious of the group, which was discovered in  1822 by Captain Bell, of the Minerva. I could now study     UNDER THE SEA 103   the madreporal system to which the islands of this ocean  are due.   Madrepores, which must not be mistaken for corals,  have a tissue covered with a calcareous crust, and the  modifications of its structure have made Mr. Milne Ed-  wards, my illustrious master, classify them into five sec-  tions. The little animalculse which these polypi secrete,  live by millions at the bottom of their cells. It is their  calcareous deposit which becomes rocks, reefs, and large  and small islands. Here they form a ring surrounding a  lagoon 01 small interior lake, which gaps put into communi-  cation with the sea. There they make barriers of reefs  like those which exist on the coasts of New Caledonia and  the different Pomotou Islands. In other places, such as  Reunion and Maurice, they raise fringed reefs, high straight  walls, near which the depths of the ocean are considerable.   As we were coasting at some cable-lengths only off the  shore of j the island of Clermont-Tonnerre I admired the  gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical work-  men. Those walls are specially the work of madrepores,  known as milleporas, porites, astraeas, and meandrines.  These polypi breed particularly in the rough beds on the  surface of the sea, and consequently it is from their upper  part that they begin their substructure, which sinks gradu-  ally with the debris of secretions which support them.   I could closely observe these curious walls, for the fathom-  line gave them perpendicularly more than 300 yards in  depth, and our electric light made the calcareous matter  shine brilliantly.   Replying to a question Conseil asked me as to how long it  took these colossal barriers to grow, I astonished him much  by telling him that learned men reckoned the growth to be  one-eighth of an inch in a century.    Then how long has it taken to raise these walls ?  he  said.    Four hundred and ninety-two thousand years, Conseil.  Besides, the formation of coal and the mineralising of the  forests buried by the deluge has taken a much longer time  still.   When the Nautilus returned to the surface of the ocean I     104 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   could take in all the development of this low and wooded  island of Clermont-Tonnerre. Its madreporal rocks were  evidently fertilised by water-spouts and tempests. One  day some grain, carried away from neighbouring land by a  tempest of wind, fell on these calcareous layers, mixed with  the decomposed detritus of fish and marine plants which  formed vegetable soil. A cocoanut, pushed along by the  waves, arrived on this new coast. The germ took root.  The tree grew and stopped the vapour of the water. Streams  were born, vegetation spread little by little. Animalculae,  worms, insects landed upon trunks of trees, torn away from  other islands by the wind. Turtles came to lay their eggs.  Birds built their nests in the young trees. In that manner  animal life was developed, and, attracted by verdure and  fertility, man appeared. Thus these islands, the immense  works of microscopical animals, were formed.   Towards evening Clermont-Tonnerre was lost in the  distance, and the route of the Nautilus was changed per-  ceptibly. After having touched the tropic of Capricorn,  in long. 135, it directed its course W.N.W., sailing up the  whole tropical zone again. On and on we travelled through  regions which, if only for their tragic associations, have be-  come historic in the marine world, and on the 25th of De-  cember the Nautilus sailed into the midst of the New  Hebrides, which was christened by Cook in 1773.   That day being Christmas Day, Ned Land seemed to me  to regret that it could not be celebrated in a manner which  is customary in all English-speaking countries.   I had not seen Captain Nemo for a week, when, on the  27th, in the morning, hf entered the saloon, looking like a  man who had seen you five minutes before. I was occupied  in tracing the route of the Nautilus on the planisphere  The captain approached, put his finger on a spot in the map,  and pronounced this one word :    Vanikoro.   This name was magical. It was the name of the islands  upon which the vessels of La Perouse had been lost. I rose  immediately.    Is the Nautilus taking us to Vanikoro ?  I asked.    Yes, professor, answered the captain.     UNDER THE SEA 105    And can I visit these celebrated islands where the  Bousscle and Astrolabe were lost ?     If you please, professor.    When shall we reach Vanikoro ?     We are there now, professor.   Followed by Captain Nemo I went up to the platform,  and from there I looked with avidity round the horizon.   To the N.E. emerged two volcanic islands of unequal  size, surrounded by coral reefs measuring forty miles in  circumference. We were in presence of Vanikoro Island.  The land seemed covered with verdure from the shore to  the summits of the interior, crowned by Mount Kapogo,  3,000 feet high.   The Nautilus, after having crossed the exterior ring of  rocks through a narrow passage, was inside the reefs where  the sea is from thirty to forty fathoms deep. Under the  verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived several  savages, who looked extremely astonished at our approach.  Perhaps they took the long body advancing along the sur-  face of the water for some formidable cetacean that they  ought to guard themselves against. At that moment  Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the ship-  wreck of La Perouse.    What every one knows, captain, I answered.    And can you tell me what every one knows ?  he  asked in a slightly ironical tone.    Easily.   I then recited an official report of the result of the ex-  pedition, an abridgment of it being as follows :  La  Perouse and his second in Command, Captain Langle, were  sent by Louis XVI, in 1785, to make a voyage round the  world. They equipped the corvettes, the Boussole and the  Astrolabe, neither of which was again heard of.    Then, remarked Captain Nemo,  they do not know  where the third vessel, built by the shipwrecked men on  the island of Vanikoro, perished ?     No one knows.   Captain Nemo answered nothing, and made me a sign to  follow him to the saloon. The Nautilus sank some yards  below the surface of the waves, and then the panels were     io6 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   drawn back. I rushed towards the window, and under the  crustations of coral covered with fungi, and through myriads  of charming fish I recognised certain iron stirrups, anchors,  cannons, bullets, capstan fittings, the stem of a ship all  objects from shipwrecked vessels. While I was looking  upon these sad remnants Captain Nemo said to me in a  grave voice    When Cammander La Perouse started with his ships  the Boussole and the Astrolabe he anchored first in Botany  Bay, visited the Friendly Isles, New Caledonia, made for  Santa Cruz, and touched at Namouka, one of the Hapai  group. Then his ships arrived on the unknown reefs of  Vanikoro. The Boussole, which went first, struck on the  south coast. The Astrolabe went to help, and met with the  same fate. The former ship was almost immediately de-  stroyed ; but the Astrolabe, sheltered by the wind, lasted  some days. The natives received the shipwrecked men  very well. They installed themselves on the island, and  built a smaller vessel with the remains of the two large ones.  Some of the sailors chose to remain at Vanikoro. The  others, weakened by illness, started with La Perouse.  They directed their course towards the Solomon Islands.  They all perished on the western coast of the principal  island of the group, between Capes Deception and Satis-  faction.    And how do you know that ?  I exclaimed.    This is what I found on the very spot of the last ship-  wreck.   Captain Nemo showed me a tin box, stamped with the  French arms, and corroded by the salt water. He opened it,  and I saw a mass of papers, yellow but still readable.  They were the instructions of the President of the Admiralty  to the Commander La Perouse, annotated on the margin  in the handwriting of Louis XVI.    Ah, that is a fine death for a sailor !  then said Captain  Nemo ;  a coral tomb is a tranquil one, and may Heaven  grant that my companions and I may never have another 1      UNDER THE SEA 107   CHAPTER XX   STRANDED   FOR several days the Nautilus travelled almost uninter-  ruptedly at a tremendous speed and on the 22nd of January  we had made 11,340 miles, or 5,250 French leagues, from  our point of departure in the Japanese seas. Before the  prow of the Nautilus extended the dangerous regions of  the coral sea on the N.E. coast of Australia. Our boat  coasted at a distance of some miles the dangerous bank on  which Captain Cook's ships were lost on June 10, 1770.   Two days after crossing the coral sea, on the 4th of  January, we sighted the Papuan coasts. On this occasion  Captain Nemo informed me that it was his intention to  get into the Indian Ocean by Torres Straits. His com-  munication ended there. Ned Land saw with pleasure  that this route would take him nearer to the European  seas.   The Torres Straits are considered the most dangerous  in the globe, obstructed by innumerable islands, reefs, and  rocks, which make its navigation almost impracticable.  Captain Nemo consequently took every precaution to cross  it. The Nautilus on a level with the surface of the water,  moved slowly along. Its screw, like the tail of a cetacean,  slowly beat the billows.   Profiting by this situation, my two companions and I  took our places on the constantly-deserted platform.  Before us rose the helmsman's cage, and I am very much  mistaken if Captain Nemo was not there directing his  Nautilus himself.   Around the Nautilus the sea was furiously rough. The  current of the waves, which was bearing from S.E. to N.W.  with a speed of two and a half miles, broke over the coral  reefs that emerged here and there,    An ugly sea !  said Ned Land to me.    Detestable indeed, I answered,  and one that s not  suitable to such a vessel as the Nautilus.    That confounded captain must be very certain of his  route, answered the Canadian, for I see coral reefs which     io8 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   would break its keel in a thousand pieces if it only just  touched them !    The situation was indeed dangerous, but the Nautilus  seemed to glide off the formidable reefs as if by enchant-  ment. It bore more northwards, coasted the Island of  Murray, and came back south-west towards Cumberland  Passage. I thought it was going to enter it, when going  back N.W. it went amongst a large quantity of little-known  islands and islets towards South Island and Mauvais Canal.   Again changing his direction, Captain Nemo cut  straight through to the west, and steered for the Island of  Bilboa. It was then three o'clock in the afternoon. The  bb tide was just beginning. The vessel was coasting at a  distance of two miles off the island, when suddenly a shock  overthrew me. The Nautilus had just touched on a reef,  and was quite still, laying lightly to port side.   When I rose I saw Captain Nemo and his second on the  platform. They were examining the situation of the vessel,  and talking in their incomprehensible dialect.   The situation was the following : Two miles on the star-  board appeared the Island of Gilboa, the coast of which was  rounded from N. to W. ; like an immense arm towards the  S. and E. some heads of coral rocks were jutting, which the  ebb tide left uncovered. We had run aground, and in one  of the seas where the tides are very slight, an unfortunate  circumstance in the floating of the Nautilus ; however, the  vessel had in no wise suffered, its keel was so solidly joined;  but although it could neither sink nor split, it ran the risk  of being for ever fastened on to these reefs, and then Cap-  tain Nemo's submarine apparatus would be done for.   I was reflecting thus, when the captain, cool and calm,  always master of himself, appearing neither vexed nor  moved, came up.    This is an incident, I bluntly remarked,  which will  perhaps again force you to become an inhabitant of the  land from which you flee.   Captain Nemo looked at me in a curious manner, and  made a negative gesture. It was as much as to say to me  that nothing would ever force him to set foot on land again.  Then he said     UNDER THE SEA 109    The Nautilus is not lost. It will yet carry you amid  the marvels of the ocean. Our voyage is only just begun,  and I do not wish to deprive myself so soon of the honour  of your company.    But, Captain Nemo, I replied, without noticing the  irony of his sentence,  the Nautilus ran aground at high tide.  Now tides are not strong in the Pacific, and if you cannot  lighten the Nautilus I do not see how it can be floated again.    Tides are not strong in the Pacific you are right pro-  fessor, answered Captain Nemo ;  but in Torres Straits  there is a difference of five feet between the level of high  and low tide. To-day is the fourth of January, and in five  days the moon will be at the full. Now I shall be very  much astonished if this complaisant satellite does not  sufficiently raise these masses of water, and render me a  service which I wish to owe to her alone.   This said, Captain Nemo, followed by his second, went  down again into the interior of the Nautilus. The vessel  remained as immovable as if in a bed of cement.    Well, sir ?  said Ned Land, who came to me after the  departure of the captain.    Ned, we must wait patiently for high tide on the ninth.  It appears that the moon will be kind enough to set us  afloat again.    And this captain is not going to weigh anchor, to set his  machine to work, or to do anything to get the vessel off ?     The tide will suffice, answered Conseil simply.   The Canadian looked at Conseil, then shrugged his  shoulders. It was the seaman who spoke in him.    Sir, he replied,  you may believe me when I tell you  that this piece of iron will never be navigated again, either  on or under the seas. I think the moment has come to part  company with Captain Nemo.    Friend Ned, I answered,  I do not despair of this  valiant Nautilus, and in four days we shall know what to  think of these tides on the Pacific. Besides, the advice to  fly might be more opportune if we were in sight of the  coasts of Europe, but in the Papuan regions it is another  thing, and it will be quite time to resort to that extremity  if the Nautilus does not succeed in getting off.     no TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    But still we might have a taste of land  replied Ned  Land.  There is an island near at hand.    There friend Ned is right, said Conseil,  and I am of  his opinion. Could not monsieur obtain from Captain  Nemo the permission to be transported to land, if it was  -only to keep accustomed to treading the solid parts of our  planet ?     I can ask him, I answered,  but he will refuse.    Let monsieur risk it, said Conseil,  and then we shall  know what to think about the captain's amiability.   To my great surprise Captain Nemo gave the permission  I asked for, and he gave it me very courteously, without  even exacting from me a promise to come back on board.  But a flight across the lands of New Guinea would have been  very perilous, and I should not have advised Ned Land to  attempt it. It was better to be a prisoner on board the  Nautilus than to fall into the hands of savage tribes.   The next day, January 5th, the long boat, its deck taken  off, was lifted from its niche, and launched from the top  of the platform. Two men sufficed for this operation. The  oars were in the boat, and we Conseil, Ned and myself  had only to take our place.   At eight o'clock, armed with guns and hatchets, we  descended the sides of the Nautilus. The sea was pretty  calm. A slight breeze was blowing from land. Conseil  and I rowed vigorously, and Ned steered in the narrow  passages between the breakers. The boat was easily  managed, and fled along rapidly.   Ned Land could not contain his joy. He was a prisoner  -escaped from prison, and did not think of the necessity of  going back to it again.    Meat !  he repeated.  We are going to eat meat,  and what meat ! Real game ! no bread, though ! I don't  say that fish is not a good thing, but you can have too much  of it, and a piece of fresh venison, grilled over burning coals,  would be an agreeable variation to our ordinary fare.    Gourmand !  said Conseil.  He makes the water  come into my mouth !     You do not know yet, I said,  if there is any game in  these forests, or if the game will not hunt the hunter hirrself.     UNDER THE SEA in   ' Well, M. Aronnax, replied the Canadian, whose teeth  seemed sharpened like the edge of a hatchet,  but I will  eat tiger a loin of tiger if there is no other quadruped  on this island.    Friend Ned is alarming, answered Conseil.    Whatever animal it is, replied Ned Land,  whether  it is one with four paws and no feathers or two paws and  feathers, it will be saluted by my first shot.    Good, I replied ;  you are already beginning to be  imprudent.    Never fear, M. Aronnax, answered the Canadian ;   row along ; I only ask twenty-five minutes to offer you a  dish of my sort.   At half-past eight the boat of the Nautilus ran softly  aground on a strand of sand, after having happily cleared  the coral reef which surrounds the Island of Gilboa.   CHAPTER XXI   SOME DAYS ON LAND   TOUCHING land again made a great impression on me.  Ned Land struck the ground with his foot as if to take  possession of it. Yet we had only been, according to  Captain Nemo's expression, the  passengers of the Nautilus  for two months that is to say, in reality, we had only  been the captain's prisoners for two months.   In a very short time we were within a gunshot of the  coast. The soil was light, and certain dried-up beds of  streams, strewed with granitic debris, showed that the  island had taken ages to form. All the horizon was hidden  by a curtain of admirable forests. Enormous trees, some 200  feet high, with garlands of creepers joining their branches,  were real natural hammocks, which were rocked in the  slight breeze. They were mimosas, ficus, casuarinas, teak-  trees, hibiscus, pendanus, palm-trees, mixed in profusion ;  and under the shelter of their verdant vault, at the foot of  their gigantic stype, grew orchids, pod-forming plants, and  ferns.   But without waiting to admire all these fine specimens  of nature's decorations the Canadian, picking out a cocoa-     H2 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   nut tree, brought down some nuts, broke them, and we  drank their milk and ate their kernel with a relish that  protested against the ordinary fare of the Nautilus.    Excellent !  said Ned Land.    Exquisite !  answered Conseil.    I do not think, said the Canadian,  that your Nemo  would object to our taking back a cargo of cocoa-nuts on  board.    I do not think so, I answered,  but he would not taste  them himself.    So much the worse for him, said Conseil.    And so much the better for us, replied Ned Land ;   there will be more left.    One word only, Land, I said to the harpooner, who  was beginning to attack another cocoa-nut tree.  Cocoa-  nuts are good things, but before filling the boat with them I  think it would be wise to see if the island does not produce  some substance no less useful. Fresh vegetables would be  well received in the kitchen of the Nautilus.    Monsieur is right, answered Conseil,  and I propose  to reserve three places in our boat one for fruit, another  for vegetables, and the third for venison, of which I have  not seen the slightest sample yet.    We should not despair of anything, Conseil, answered  the Canadian.    Let us go on with our excursion, I replied,  and keep  a sharp look-out. Although the island appears to be in-  habited, it might contain individuals who would be easier  to please than we on the nature of the game.    Ha ! ha !. said Ned Land, with a very significant move-  ment of the jaw.    What is it, Ned ?  cried Conseil.    I am beginning to understand the charms of canni-  balism, answered the Canadian.    What are you talking about, Ned ?  replied Conseil.   If you are a cannibal, I shall no longer feel safe with you  in the same cabin ! Shall I wake one day and find myself  half devoured ?     Friend Conseil, I like you very much, but not enough  to eat you.     UNDER THE SEA 113    I mistrust you, answered Conseil, jokingly.  Well,  let us start ; we must really bring down some game to  satisfy this cannibal, or one of these fine mornings monsieur  will only find pieces of a servant to serve him.   Conversing thus we penetrated the depths of the forest,  and for two hours walked about it in every direction.   Fortune favoured us in this search after supplies, and  one of the most useful products of tropical zones furnished  us with a valuable article of food which was wanting on  board I mean the bread-tree, which is very abundant in  the Island of Gilboa. This tree was distinguished from  others by its straight trunk forty feet high ; its summit,  gracefully rounded by a thick formation of leaves. From  its mass of verdure stood out large globular fruit two and  a-half inches wide, with a rough skin in an hexagonal  pattern a useful vegetable, with which Nature has  gratified the regions in which wheat is wanting, and which,  without exacting any culture, gives fruit for eight months  in the year. Ned Land knew this fruit well ; he had eaten it  before in his numerous voyages, and he knew how to pre-  pare it. The sight of it excited his appetite, and he could  contain himself no longer.    Sir, he said to me,  may I die if I don't taste a little  of that bread-fruit !     Taste, friend Ned taste as much as you like. We are  here to make experiments ; let us make them.    It will not take long, answered the Canadian ; and  with a burning-glass he lighted a fire of dead wood which  loudly crackled.    It is better than bread, added the Canadian ;  it is  like delicate pastry. Have you never eaten any, sir ?     No, Ned, replied Conseil.    Well, then, prepare for somethingvery good. If you don't  return to the charge I am no longer the king of harpooners.   In a short time the side exposed to the fire was quite  black. In the interior appeared a white paste and a sort of  tender crumb, with a taste something like that of an arti-  choke.   It must be acknowledged this bread was excellent, and I  ate it with great pleasure.     U4 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Unfortunately, I said,  such paste will not keep  fresh ; and it appears useless to me to make any provision  for the vessel.    Why, sir, cried Ned Land,  you speak like a naturalist,  but I am going to act like a baker. Gather some of the  fruit, Conseil ; we will take it on our return.    And how do you prepare it ?  I asked.    By making a fermented paste with its pulp, which will  keep any length of time. When I wish to use it I will have  it cooked in the kitchen on board ; and, notwithstanding  its slightly acid taste, you will find it excellent.    Then, Ned, I see that nothing is wanting to this  bread.    Yes, professor, answered the Canadian ;  we want  fruit, or at least vegetables.    Let us seek the fruit and vegetables.   When our gathering was over we set out to complete this  terrestrial dinner. Our search was not a vain one, and  towards noon we had made an ample provision of bananas.  With these, we gathered enormous  jaks  with a very de-  cided taste, savoury mangoes, and pine-apples of an in-  credible size. But this gathering took up a great deal of  our time, which there was no cause to regret.   Conseil watched Ned continually. The harpooner  marched on in front, and during his walk across the forest he  gathered with a sure hand the excellent fruit with which to  complete his provisions.    You do not want anything more, Ned, do you ?     Hum, said the Canadian.    Why, what have you to complain of ?     All these vegetables cannot constitute a meal, an-  swered Ned ;  they are only good for dessert. There is  the soup and the roast.    Yes, said I.  Ned had promised us cutlets, which  seemed to me very problematic.    Sir, answered the Canadian,  our sport is not only  not ended, but is not even begun. Patience ! We shall  end by meeting with some animal or bird, and if it is not  in this place it will be in another.    And if it is not to-day it will be to-morrow, added Con-     UNDER THE SEA 115   sell,  for we must not go too far away. I vote we go  back to the boat now.   ' What, already ?  cried Ned.   ' We must return before night, I said.   ' What time is it ?  asked the Canadian.   ' Two o'clock at least, answered Conseil.   ' How the time flies on dry land !  cried Ned Land  with a sigh of regret.   We came back across the forest, and completed our  provision by making a raid on palm cabbages, which  we were obliged to gather at the summit of the trees.  We were overburdened when we arrived at the boat, yet  Ned Land did not think his pro visions sufficient. But for-  tune favoured him. At the moment of embarking he  perceived several trees from twenty-five to thirty feet high,  belonging to the palm species. These trees, by no means  numerous, are justly counted amongst the most useful  products of Malaysia. There were sago-trees, vegetables  which grow without culture, and reproduce themselves  like blackberries by their shoots and seeds. Ned Land  knew how to treat these trees. He took his hatchet, and,  using it vigorously, he soon brought two or three sago-trees  level with the ground, their ripeness being recognised by the  white powder dusted over their branches.   I watched him more with the eyes of a naturalist than  those of a famished man. He began by stripping the bark  from each trunk, an inch thick, which covered a network  of long fibres, forming inextricable knots, that a sort of  gummy flour cemented. This flour was sago, an edible  substance which forms the principal article of food of the  Melanasian population. Ned Land was content for the  time being to cut these trunks in pieces, as he would have  done wood to burn, meaning to extract the flour later on,  and to pass it through a cloth in order to separate it from  its fibrous ligaments, to leave it to dry in the sun, and let it  harden in moulds.   At last, at five o'clock in the evening, loaded with our  riches, we left the shores of the island, and half an hour  later reached the Nautilus. No one appeared on our  arrival. The enormous iron cylinders seemed deserted.   H     n6 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   When the provisions were embarked I went down to my  room. There I found my supper ready. I ate it, and then  went to sleep.   The next day, January 6th, there was nothing new on  board. No noise in the interior, not a sign of life. The  canoe had remained alongside in the very place where we  had left it. We resolved to return to the Island of Gilboa.  Ned Land hoped to be more fortunate than before from a  hunting point of view, and wished to visit another part of  the forest.   We set out at sunrise. The boat, carried away by the  waves, which were flowing inland, reached the island in a  few minutes. We landed, and thinking it was better to  trust to the instinct of the Canadian, we followed Ned Land,  whose long legs threatened to out-distance us. Ned Land  went up the coast westward, and fording some beds of  streams, he reached the high plain bordered by the admir-  able forests. Some kingfishers were on the banks of the  stream, but they would not let themselves be approached ;  their circumspection proved to me that these fowl knew  what to think of bipeds of our sort, and I therefore concluded  that, if the island was not inhabited, it was at least fre-  quented by human beings. After having crossed some  rich meadow land we reached the borders of a little wood,  animated by the song and flight of a great number of birds.    There are only birds yet, said Conseil.    But some of them are good to eat, answered the har-  pooner.    No, friend Ned, replied Conseil,  for I see nothing but  simple parrots.    Friend Conseil, answered Ned gravely,  a parrot is  the friend of those who have nothing else to eat.    And I may add, I said,  that this bird, well prepared,  is quite worth eating.   Under the thick foliage of this wood, a whole world of  parrots were flying from branch to branch, only waiting for a  better education to speak the human language. At present  they were screeching in company with paroquets of all  colours, grave cockatoos who seemed to be meditating  upon some philosophical problem, whilst the lories, of a     UNDER THE SEA 117   bright red colour, passed like a morsel of stamen carried  off by the breeze, amidst kalaos of noisy flight, papouas,  painted with the finest shades of azure, and a whole variety  of charming, but generally not edible, birds.   After having crossed a thicket of moderate thickness we  found a plain again obstructed with bushes. I then saw a  magnificent bird rise, the disposition of whose long tails  forces them to fly against the wind. The undulating flight,  the grace of their aerial curves, the play of their colours,  attracted and charmed the eye. I had no trouble to recog-  nise them.    Birds of Paradise !  I cried.    Family of partridges ?  asked Ned Land.    I do not think so, Land. Nevertheless, I count on  your skill to catch one of these charming productions of  tropical nature.    I will try, professor, although I am more accustomed  to handle the harpoon than the gun.   The Malays, who carry on a great trade with these birds  with the Chinese, have several means of taking them which  we cannot employ. Sometimes they place nets on the  summits of high trees which the birds frequent. Some-  times they catch them with birdlime, or they even poison  the fountains that the birds generally drink from. We  were obliged to fire at them while flying, which gave us  few chances of hitting them, and, in fact, we exhausted in  vain a part of our ammunition.   About ii a.m. we had traversed the first range of moun-  tains that form the centre of the island, and we had killed  nothing. Hunger drove us on. The hunters had relied  on the products of the chase, and they had done wrong.  Fortunately, Conseil, to his great surprise, made a double  shot, and secured breakfast. He bought down two wood  pigeons, which, quickly plucked and suspended to a skewer,  were roasted before a flaming fire of dead wood. Nut-  megs, with which they are in the habit of stuffing their crops,  flavers the flesh of these birds, and makes it delicious.    It is like the fowls that eat truffles, said Conseil.    And now, Ned, what is there wanting ?  I asked the  Canadian.     u8 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Some four-footed game, M. Arronax, answered Ned  Land.  All these pigeons are only side-dishes and mouth-  fuls, and until I have killed an animal with cutlets I shall  not be content.    Nor I, Ned, until I have caught a bird of Paradise.    Let us go on with our hunting, answered Conseil,   but towards the sea. I think we had better regain the  forest regions.   It was sensible advice, and was followed. After an hour's  walk we reached a veritable forest of sago-trees. Some  inoffensive serpents were disturbed at the sound of our  footsteps. The birds of Paradise fled at our approach, and  I really despaired of getting near them, when Conseil, who  was walking on in front, suddenly stooped, uttered a cry of  triumph, and came back to me, carrying a magnificent  bird of Paradise.    Ah, bravo ! Conseil, I exclaimed.    Monsieur is very kind, answered Conseil.    No, my boy, that was a master stroke, not only to take  one of these birds living, but to catch it simply by hand.    If master will examine it closely, he will see that my  merit has not been great.    Why, Conseil ?     Because this bird is intoxicated.    Intoxicated ?     Yes, intoxicated with the nutmegs he was devouring  under the nutmeg-tree where I found him. See, friend  Ned, see the monstrous effects of intemperance.    You need not grudge me the gin I've drunk the last two  months !  answered the Canadian.   In the meantime I examined the curious bird. Conseil  was not mistaken. The bird, intoxicated by the spiritu-  ous juice, was powerless. It could not fly, and could hardly  walk.   It belonged to the finest of the eight species which are  counted in Papua and the neighbouring islands. It was   the large emerald, one of the rarest. It measured nine  inches in length, its head was relatively small, and its  eyes, placed near the opening of the beak, were small too.  But its colours were admirable ; it had a yellow beak, brown     UNDER THE SEA 119   legs and claws, nut-coloured wings with purple borders, a  pale yellow head, emerald throat, and maroon breast. Two  horned downy nets rose above the tail, that was prolonged  by two very light feathers of admirable fineness, completing  the effect of this marvellous bird.   I had a longing to take this superb specimen back to  Paris in order that I might make a present of it to the Jardin  des Plantes, which does not possess a single living one.    Is it so rare, then ?  asked the Canadian, in the tone of  a hunter who does not care much for it as game.    Very rare, my brave companion, and, above all, very  difficult to take alive, and even dead these birds are the  object of an important traffic. Hence the natives fake  then as pearls and diamonds are fabricated.    What !  cried Conseil,  they make false birds of Para-  dise ?     Yes, Conseil.    Does monsieur know how the natives set about it ?     Perfectly. These birds, during the eastern monsoon,  lose the magnificent feathers which surround their tails.  The natives gather up these feathers, which they skil-  fully fasten on to some poor parrot previously mutilated.  Then they die the sutufe, varnish the bird, and send this  fraudulent product of their industry to some innocent  amateur collector in Europe.    Good !  said Ned Land ;  if the collector has not the  bird he at least has its feathers, and as he does not want  to eat it, I see no harm !    But if my desires were satisfied by the possession of the  bird of Paradise, the Canadian's were not yet. Happily,  about two o'clock Ned Land killed a magnificent hog, one  of those the natives call  bari-outang. The animal  came in time to give us real quadruped meat, and it was  well received. Ned Land was very proud of his shot. The  hog, struck by the electric bullet, had fallen stone dead.   The Canadian soon skinned and prepared it after having  cut out half-a-dozen cutlets to furnish us with grilled meat  for our evening meal. Then we went on with the chase  that was again to be marked by Ned and Conseil's exploits.   The two friends, by beating the bushes, roused a herd of     TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   kangaroos which bounded away. But they did not take  flight too rapidly for the electric capsule to stop them in  their course.    Ah, professor, cried Ned Land, excited by the pleasure  of hunting,  what excellent game, especially stewed !  What provisions for the Nautilus ! Two, three, five down I  And when I think that we shall eat all that meat, and that  those imbeciles on board will not have a mouthful !    I think that in his delight the Canadian, if he had not  talked so much, would have slaughtered the whole herd 1  But he contented himself with a dozen.   These animals were small. They belong to a species of  kangaroo  rabbits  that live habitually in the hollow of  trees, and possess extraordinary speed. They furnish ex-  cellent meat.   We were very much satisfied with the result of our hunt.  The delighted Ned proposed to return the next day to this  enchanted island, which he wanted to clear of all its edible  quadrupeds. But he reckoned without circumstances.   At 6 p.m. we returned to the shore. Our boat was  stranded in its place. The Nautilus, like a long rock,  emerged from the waves two miles from the island. Ned  Land, without more delay, began to prepare the dinner,  and showed that he was familiar with culinary work. The  hog cutlets grilled on the cinders, soon scented the air with  a delicious odour.   The dinner was excellent. Two wood-pigeons completed  this extraordinary bill of fare. The sago paste, the arto-  carpus bread, mangoes, half-a-dozen pineapples, and the fer-  mented liquor of some cocoa-nuts delighted us. I even  think that the ideas of my worthy companions were not so  clear as they might be.    Suppose we do not return to the Nautilus this evening,  said Conseil.    Suppose we never return, added Ned Land.   Just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the har-  pooner's proposition.     UNDER THE SEA 121   CHAPTER XXII   CAPTAIN NEMO'S THUNDERBOLT   WE looked towards the forest without rising, my hand  stopping in its movement towards my mouth, Ned Land's  completing its office.    A stone does not fall from the sky, said Conseil,  ' without deserving the name of aerolite.   A second stone, carefully rounded, which struck out of  Conseil's hand a savoury pigeon's leg, gave still more  weight to his observations.   We all three rose and shouldered our guns, ready to reply  to any attack.    Can they be monkeys ?  asked Ned Land.    Something like them, answered Conseil ;  they are  savages.    The boat, said I, making for the sea. In fact, we were  obliged to beat a retreat, for about twenty natives armed  with bows and slings, appeared on the skirts of the thicket  that hid the horizon one hundred steps off.   Our boat was anchored at about sixty feet from us.   The savages approached us, not running, making most  hostile demonstrations. It rained stones and arrows.   Ned Land did not wish to leave his provisions, notwith-  standing the imminence of the danger. He went on toler-  ably fast with his pig on one side and his kangaroos on the  other.   In two minutes we were on shore. It was the affair of an  instant to land the boat with the provisions and arms, to  push it into the sea, and to take the two oars. We had not  gone two cables' length when a hundred savages, howling  and gesticulating, entered the water up to their waists. I  watched to see if their appearance would not attract some  men from the Nautilus on to the platform.   But no. The enormous machine, lying off, seemed ab-  solutely deserted. Twenty minutes after we ascended the  sides ; the panels were open. After we had made the boat  fast we re-entered the interior of the Nautilus.   I went to the saloon, from whence I heard some music.     122 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Captain Nemo was there, bending over his organ, and  plunged into a musical ecstasy.    Captain, I said to him.   He did not hear me.   Captain, I repeated, touching his hand.   He shuddered and turned.    Ha, is it you, professor ?  he said to me.  Well, have  you had good sport ? Have you botanised successfully ?    Yes, captain, answered I,  but we have,unfortunately,  attracted a regiment of savages, and their appearance may  be dangerous.    Savages ?  answered Captain Nemo in an ironical  tone.  And you are astonished, professor, that having  set foot on one of the lands of this globe, you find savages  there ? Where are there no savages ? Besides, those you  call savages, are they worse than others ?     But, captain     For my part, sir, I have met with some everywhere.    Well! I answered,  if you do not wish to receive any  on board the Nautilus, you will do well to take some pre-  cautions.    Make yourself easy, professor ; there is nothing worth  troubling about.    But these natives are numerous.    How many did you count ?     A hundred at least.    M. Aronnax, answered Captain Nemo, who had again  placed his fingers on the organ keys,  if all the natives of  Papua were gathered together on that shore, the Nautilus  would have nothing to fear from their attacks.   The captain's fingers were then running over the keys of  the instrument, and I noticed that he only struck the black  keys, which gave to his melodies an essentially Scotch  character. He had soon forgotten my presence, and was  plunged into a reverie that I did not seek to dissipate.   I went up again on to the platform. Night had already  come, for in this low latitude the sun sets rapidly, and there  is no twilight. I could only see the island indistinctly.  But the numerous fires lighted on the beach showed that  the natives did not intend leaving it.     UNDER THE SEA 123   I remained thus alone for several hours, sometimes think-  ing about the natives.but not otherwise anxious about them,  for the imperturbable confidence of the captain gained upon  me, sometimes forgetting them to admire the splendours  of the tropical night. The moon shone brilliantly amidst  the constellations of the zenith. I then thought that this  faithful and complaisant satellite would come back to-  morrow to the same place to draw the waves and tear  away the Nautilus from its coral bed. About midnight,  seeing that all was tranquil on the dark waves, as well as  under the trees on the shore, I went down to my cabin and  went peacefully to sleep.   The night passed without adventure. The Papuans  were, doubtless, frightened by the very sight of the monster  stranded in the bay, for the open panels would have given  them easy access to the interior of the Nautilus.   At 6 a.m., on January 8th, I went up on the platform.  The morning was breaking. The island soon appeared  through the rising mists, its shores first, then its summits.   The natives were still there, more numerous than the  day before, perhaps five or six hundred strong. Some of  them, taking advantage of the low tide, had come on to the  coral heads at less than two cables' length from the Nautilus.  I easily recognised them. They were real Papuans of alh-  letic stature, men of fine breed, with wide high foreheads,  large, but not broad, and flat noses, and white teeth.  Their woolly hair, dyed red, showed off their bodies, black  and shining. From the cut and distended lobes of their  ears hung bone chaplets. These savages were generally  naked. Amongst them were some women, dressed from  the hips to the knees in a veritable crinoline of herbs, which  hung to a vegetable waistband. Some of the chiefs had  ornamented their necks with a crescent and collar of red  and white glass beads. Nearly all were armed with bows,  arrows, and shields, carrying on their shoulders a sort of  net, containing the rounded stones which they threw with  great skill from their slings.   One of these chiefs, rather near the Nautilus, was ex-  amining it attentively. He must have been of high rank  among the tribe, for he was draped in a plaited garment     124 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   of banana-leaves, scalloped at the edges, and set off with  brilliant colours. I could easily have shot this native, who  was within short range, but I thought it better to wait for  really hostile demonstrations. Between Europeans and  savages it is better that the savages should make the attack.   During the whole time of low water these natives roamed  about near the Nautilus, but they were not noisy. I heard  them frequently repeat the word  Assai, and from their  gestures I understood that they invited me to land, an  invitation that I thought it better to decline.   So on that day we did not leave the vessel, to the great  displeasure of Ned Land, who could not complete his  provisions. This skilful Canadian employed his time in  preparing the meat and other substances he had brought  from the Island of Gilboa. As to the savages, they returned  to land about n a.m., as soon as the heads of coral began to  disappear under the waves of the rising tide. But I saw  their number considerably increase on the shore. It was  probable that they came from the neighbouring islands,  or from Papua proper. However, I had not seen a single  native canoe.   Having nothing better to do, I thought of dragging these  limpid waters, under which was a profusion of shells,  zoophytes, and marine plants. It was, moreover, the last  day the Nautilus was to pass in these seas if it was set  afloat the next day, accordingto Captain Nemo's expectation.   I therefore called Conseil, who brought me a small light  drag, something like those used in the oyster-fisheries.    What about these savages ?  Conseil asked me.  They  do not seem to me to be very cruel.    They are cannibals, however, my boy.    It is possible to be a cannibal and an honest man,  answered Conseil,  as it is possible to be a gourmand and  honest. One does not exclude the other.    Good, Conseil ! I grant you there are honest cannibals,  and that they honestly devour their prisoners. But as I  do not care about being eaten, even honestly, I shall take  care what I am about, for the commander of the Nautilus  does not appear to be taking any precaution. And now to  work.     UNDER THE SEA 125   For two hours our dragging went on actively, but with-  out bringing up any rarity. The drag was filled with  Midas-ears, harps, melames, and, particularly, the finest  hammers I ever saw. We also took some pearl oysters,  and a dozen small turtles, which were kept for the pantry on;  board.   But at the very moment when I contemplated finishing  my research I put my hand on a marvel I ought to say on-  a natural deformity very rarely met with. Conseil had  1ust brought up the drag full of ordinary shells when all  at once he saw me thrust my hand into the net, draw out a  shell, and utter a note of exclamation.    Eh ? what is the matter with monsieur ?  asked Con-  seil, much surprised.  Has monsieur been bitten ?     No, my boy ; and yet I would willingly have paid for  my discovery with the loss of a finger.    What discovery ?     This shell, I said, showing the object of my triumph.    Is it simply an olive porphyry-shell.    Yes, Conseil, but instead of this spiral being from right  to left this olive turns from left to right 1     It is possible ?  cried Conseil.    Yes, my boy ; it is a sinister shell.    A sinister shell !  repeated Conseil with a palpitating  heart.    Look at its spiral.    Ah, monsieur may believe me, said Conseil, taking  the precious shell with a trembling hand,  I have never felt  a. like emotion !    And there was cause for emotion. Conseil and I were  plunged in the contemplation of our treasure, and I was  promising myself to enrich the museum with it, when a  stone, untowardly hurled by a native, broke the precious  object in Conseil's hand.   I uttered a cry of despair ! Conseil seized my gun, and  aimed at a savage who was swinging his sling in the air  about ten yards from him. I wished to stop him, but he  had fired and broken the bracelet of amulets which hung  upon the arm of the native.    Conseil I  I cried Conseil 1      126 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    What, does not monsieur see that this cannibal began  the attack ?     A shell is not worth a man's life,' I said.    Ah, the rascal !  cried Conseil ;  I would rather he  had broken my arm !    Conseil was sincere, but I was not of his opinion. How-  ever, the situation had changed during the last few minutes,  and we had not perceived it. About twenty canoes then  surrounded the Nautilus. These, hollowed in the trunks of  trees, long, narrow, and well calculated for speed, were kept  in equilibrium by means of double balances of bamboo,  which floated on the surface of the water. They were  worked by skilful paddlers, and their approach made me  uneasy. It was evident that these Papuans had already  had some relations with Europeans, and knew their ships.  But what must they have thought of this long iron cylinder,  without either masts or funnel ? Nothing good, but they  kept first at a respectful distance. However, seeing it did  not move, they regained confidence by degrees and tried  to familiarise themselves with it. Now it was precisely  this familiarity which it was necessary to prevent. Our  arms, which made no noise, could only produce an indifferent  effect on these natives, who only respect noisy weapons.  A thunderbolt without the rolling of thunder would not  much frighten men, although the danger exists in the  lightning and not in the noise.   Then the canoes approached nearer the Nautilus, and a  shower of arrows fell upon it.    Why, it hails, said Conseil,  and perhaps poisoned  hail.    I must tell Captain Nemo, said I, going through the  panel.   I went down to the saloon. I found no one there. I  ventured to knock at the door of the captain's room.   A  Come in !  answered me.   I entered, and found Captain Nemo occupied with a  calculation in which algebraical signs were plentiful.    I fear I am disturbing you, said I.    Yes, M. Aronnax, answered the captain,  but I think  you must have serious reasons for seeing me.     UNDER THE SEA 127    Very serious ; we are surrounded by the canoes of the  natives, and in a few minutes we shall certainly be assailed  by several hundreds of savages.    Ah, said Captain Nemo, tranquilly,  so they are here  with their canoes ?     Yes.    Well, all we have to do is to shut the panels.    Precisely, and I came to tell you.    Nothing is easier, said Captain Nemo.   Pressing an electric bell he transmitted an order to the  crew's quarters.    That's done, sir, said he after a few minutes ;  the  boat is in its place, and the panels are shut. You do not  fear, I imagine, that these gentlemen can break in walls  which the balls from your frigate could not touch ?     No, captain, but there exists another danger.    What is that sir ?     It is that to-morrow, at the same time, you will be  obliged to open the panels to renew the air of the Nautilus.    Certainly, sir, as our vessel breathes like the whales  do.    Now, if at that moment the Papuans occupied the  platform, I do not know how you could prevent them  entering.    Then you believe they will get up on the vessel ?     I am certain of it.    Well, let them. I see no reason for preventing them.  These Papuans are poor devils, and I will not let my visit  to Gilboa interfere with the life of one poor wretch.   That said, I was going to withdraw, but Captain Nemo  retained me, and invited me to take a seat near him. He  questioned me with interest about our excursions on land  and our sport, and he did not seem to understand the need  for meat that impassioned the Canadian. Then the con-  versation touched upon divers subjects, and without being  more communicative, Captain Nemo showed himself more  amiable.   Amongst other things we spoke of the present position  of the Nautilus, abandoned precisely in this strait, where  Dumont d'Urville was nearly lost.     128 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    He was one of your great seamen, said the captain,   one of your intelligent navigators, this D'Urville ! He  was the French Captain Cook. Unfortunate savant I  after having braved the southern ice-banks, the coral  reefs of Oceania, and the cannibals of the Pacific, to perish  miserably in a railway train ! If that energetic man could  think during the last seconds of his existence, you imagine  what must have been his last thoughts !    Whilst speaking thus Captain Nemo seemed moved, and  I put this emotion to his credit.   Then, map in hand, we looked over again the works of the  French navigator, his voyages of circumnavigation, his  double attempt to reach the South Pole that led to the  discovery of Adelie and Louis Philippe Lands ; lastly, his  hydrographical surveys of the principal Oceanian islands.    What your D'Urville did on the surface I have done in  the interior of the ocean, said Captain Nemo,  and more  easily and completely than he.    However, captain, I said,  there is one point of  resemblance between the full-rigged warships of Dumont  d'Urville and the Nautilus.    What is that, sir ?     The Nautilus is stranded like them.    The Nautilus is not stranded, replied Captain Nemo  coldly.  The Nautilus is made to repose on the bed of  the waters, and the difficult work, the manoeuvres that  D'Urville was obliged to have recourse to, to get his ships  afloat again, I shall not undertake. To-morrow, at the  said day and hour, the tide will quickly raise the Nautilus,  and it will recommence its navigation through the seas.    Captain, I said,  I do not doubt.    To-morrow, added the captain, rising  to-morrow  at 2.40 p.m. the Nautilus will be afloat again, and I will  leave Torres Straits without damage.   These words pronounced in a very curt tone, Captain  Nemo bowed slightly. It was my dismissal, and I went  back to my room.   There I found Conseil, who desired to know the result of  my interview with the captain.    My boy, I replied,  when I seemed to think that his     UNDER THE SEA 129   vessel was threatened by the natives of Papua, the captain  answered me very ironically. I have, therefore, only one  thing to say to you have confidence in him, and go to  sleep in peace.    Does monsieur require my services ?    No, my friend. What is Ned Land doing ?     He is making a kangaroo pasty that will be a marvel !    I was left alone. I went to bed, but slept badly. I  heard the savages stamping about on the platform making  a deafening noise. The night passed thus, the crew appar-  ently treating the disturbance with indifference. They  were not more anxious about the presence of these cannibals  than the soldiers of an ironclad fortress would be about  the ants that crawl over the iron.   I rose at 6 a.m. The panels had not been opened. The  air, therefore, had not been renewed in the interior, but  the reservoirs, filled ready for any event, sent some cubic  yards of oxygen into the impoverished atmosphere of the  Nautilus.   I worked in my room till noon without seeing Captain  Nemo, even for an instant. There seemed to be no pre-  paration for departure made on board.   I waited for some time longer, and then went into the  saloon. The clock was at half-past two. In ten minutes  the tide would be at its maximum, and if Captain Nemo  had not made a boasting promise the Nautilus would be  immediately set free. If not, many months would pass  before it would leave its coral bed.   In the meantime several shocks were felt in the hull of the  vessel. A grating noise arose from its sides.   At 2.35 p.m. Captain Nemo appeared in the saloon.   'We are going to start, he said.   ' Ah !  I said.   ' I have given orders to have the panels opened.   ' What about the Papuans ?    ' The Papuans ?  answered Captain Nemo, slightly  raising his shoulders.    Will they not penetrate into the interior of the  Nautilus ?     How can they ?      130 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Through the panels you have had opened.    M. Aronnax, answered Captain Nemo, tranquilly,   it is not so easy to enter the Nautilus through its panels,  even when they are opened.   I looked at the captain.    You do not understand ?  he asked.    Not at all.    Well, come, and you will see.   I went towards the central staircase. There Ned Land  and Conseil, much puzzled, were looking at some of the  crew, who were opening the panels, whilst cries of rage and  fearful shouts resounded outside.   The lids were opened on the outside. Seventy horrible  faces appeared. But the first of the natives who put his  hands on the balustrade, was thrown backwards by some  invisible force, and fled, howling and making extraordinary  gambols.   Ten of his companions succeeded him. Ten had the  same fate.   Conseil was in ecstasies. Ned Land, carried away by  his violent instincts, sprang up the staircase. But as soon  as he had seized the hand-rail with both hands he was  overthrown in his turn.    Great Scott !  he cried.  I am thunderstruck.   That word explained it all to me. It was no longer a  hand rail but a metal cable, charged with electricity.  Whoever touched it felt a formidable shock, and that shock  would have been mortal if Captain Nemo had thrown all  the current of his apparatus into this conductor. It may  be truly said that between his assailants and himself he had  hung an electric barrier that no one could cross with  impunity.   In the meantime the frightened Papuans had beaten a  retreat, maddened with terror. We, half-laughing, con-  soled and rubbed down the unfortunate Ned Land, who  was swearing like a trooper.   In the meantime the Nautilus, raised by the last tidal  waves, left its coral bed at the exact moment fixed by the  Captain. Its screws beat the waves with majestic slowness.  Its speed increased by degrees, and navigating on the     UNDER THE SEA 131   surface of the ocean, it left safe and sound the dangerous  passages of Torres Straits.   CHAPTER XXIII   CROCODILE WORSHIP   THE following day, the loth of January, the Nautilus  resumed its course under the water, but at a remarkable  speed, which I could not estimate at less than thirty-five  miles an hour. The rapidity of its screw was such that  I could neither follow its turns nor count them.   When I thought that this marvellous electric agent, after  having given movement, warmth, and light to the Nautilus,  protected it likewise from exterior attacks, and transformed  it into a holy ark, which no profane person could touch with-  out being thunderstruck, my admiration was unbounded,  and from the apparatus it ascended to the engineer who  had created it.   We were speeding directly westward, and on January  nth we doubled Cape Wessel, which forms the eastern  point of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The reefs were still  numerous, but farther apart, and marked on the chart with  extreme precision. The Nautilus easily avoided the Money  Reefs on the larboard, and the Victoria Reefs on the star-  board, situated in 130 long., and in the loth parallel we  were rigorously following.   The I3th of January Captain Nemo arrived in the sea of  Timor and sighted the island of the name in longitude  122. This island, the surface of which measures 16,255  square leagues, is governed by radjahs. These princes  call themselves sons of crocodiles that is to say, issues of  the highest origin to which a human being can pretend.  Their scaly ancestors swarm in the rivers of the island,  and are the objects of particular veneration. They are  protected, spoiled, worshipped, fed, young girls are offeied  to them as thank-offerings, and woe to the stranger who  lays hands on one of these sacred reptiles.   But the Nautilus had nothing to do with these ugly  animals. Timor was only visible for an instant at noon,  whilst the first officer took our bearings. I likewise only   I     132 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   caught a glimpse of Kitti Island that forms a part of the  group, and of which the women have a well-established  reputation for beauty in Malaysian markets.   From this point the prow of the Nautilus was set for the  Indian Ocean. Where was Captain Nemo's caprice going  to take us to ? Would he go up towards the coast of Asia,  or approach the shores of Europe ? Both hardly probable  resolutions for a man to take who was flying from inhabited  continents. Would he then go down south ? Would he  double the Cape of Good Hope, then Cape Horn, and push  on the Antarctic Pole? Would he afterwards return  to the seas of the Pacific, where his Nautilus would find easy  navigation ? The future would show us.   On the i4th of January no land was visible. The speed  of the Nautilus was singularly slackened, and very capri-  cious in its movements ; sometimes it swam amidst the  waters, sometimes floated on their surface.   During this period of the voyage Captain Nemo made  interesting experiments on the different temperatures of  the sea at different depths. In ordinary conditions these  experiments are only made by means of complicated  instruments, and are often doubtful, whether made by  thermometric sounding lines, the glasses of which often  break under the pressure of the water, or by apparatus based  on the variation of resistance in metals to electric currents.  The results thus obtained cannot be sufficiently controlled.  On the contrary, Captain Nemo went himself to seek the  temperature in the different depths, and his thermometer  put into communication with the different liquid sheets gave  him immediately and surely the degree he sought.   It was thus that, either by filling its reservoirs or de-  scending obliquely by its inclined planes, the Nautilus  successfully reached depths of three, four, five, seven, nine,  and ten thousand metres, and the definitive result of these  experiments was that the sea presented a permanent tem-  perature of four and a half degrees at a depth of one  thousand metres under all latitudes.   I followed these experiments with the most lively interest.  Captain Nemo studied them with passion. I often asked  myself to what end he made these observations. Was it     UNDER THE SEA 133   for the good of his fellow-creatures ? It was not probable,  for one day his work must perish with him in some un-  known sea unless he destined the results of his experiments  for me. But that was to admit that my strange voyage  would have a term, and this term I did not yet perceive.   However that may be, Captain Nemo told me of different  calculations obtained by him which established the different  evidence about the density of water in the principal seas  of the globe. From that communication I drew some  personal information which was not at all scientific.   It was during the morning of i he I5th of January. The  captain, with whom I was walking on the platform, asked  me if I knew the different densities of sea- water. I answered  in the negative, and added that rigorous observations were  wanting to science on this subject.    I have made those observations, he said to me,   and I can affirm that they are correct.    That may be, I answered,  but the Nautilus is a  world in itself, and the secrets of its explorer do not reach  the earth.    You are right, professor, he answered after a short  silence ;  it is a world in itself. It is as much a stranger to  the world as those planets that accompany this globe round  the sun, and the world will never know the work of the  savants in Jupiter and Saturn. Still, as chance has united  our two lives, I give you the result of my observations.    I shall be glad to hear it, captain.    You know, professor, that sea- water is denser than fresh  water, but that its density is not uniform. In fact, if I  represent by one the density of fresh water, I find a twenty-  eight-thousandth for the waters of the Atlantic, a twenty-  six-thousandth for those of the Pacific, a thirty-thousandth  for those of the Mediterranean     Ah, thought I,  he adventures into the Mediter-  ranean.    An eighteen -thousandth for the waters of the Ionian  Sea, and a twenty-thousandth for those of the Adriatic.   Decidedly the Nautilus did not avoid the frequented  seas of Europe, and I hence concluded that it would take  us perhaps before long towards more civilised lands. I     134 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   thought that Ned Land would learn this detail with very  natural satisfaction.   We passed several days in making all sorts of experiments  on the saltness of the sea at different depths, on its electrifi-  cation, coloration, transparency, and in all of them Captain  Nemo displayed an ingenuity which was only equalled by  his kindness towards me. Then, for some days, I saw him  no longer, and again remained isolated on board.   On the i6th of January the Nautilus seemed to be sleeping  at some yards only below the surface of the waves. Its  electric apparatus was idle, and its immovable screw let it  be rocked at the will of the currents. I supposed that the  crew was occupied with repairs necessitated by the violence  of the mechanical movements of the machine.   My companions and I were then witnesses of a curious  spectacle. The panels of the saloon were open, and as the  electric lantern of the Nautilus was not lighted, a vague  obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters. The sky,  which was stormy, and covered with thick clouds, only  gave an insufficient light to the first depths of the ocean.   I was looking at the state of the sea under these con-  ditions, and the largest fish only looked to me like half-  formed shadows, when all at once the Nautilus was in broad  light. I thought at first that the lantern had been relighted,  and was projecting its electric brilliancy upon the liquid  mass. I was mistaken, and after a rapid observation saw  my error.   The Nautilus was floating amidst a phosphorescent  layer, which in such obscurity became dazzling. It was  produced by myriads of luminous microscopic creatures, the  light of which was increased by being reflected against the  metallic hull of the vessel. I then saw sheets of lightning  amidst these luminous layers, like molten lead melted in a  furnace, or metallic masses heated red hot, in such a manner  that by opposition certain luminous portions made a  shadow in this ignited medium, from which all shadow  seemed as though it ought to be banished. No ! it was  not the calm radiancy of our habitual light. There was  an unwonted vigour and movement in it. We felt that the  light was living.     UNDER THE SEA 135   During several hours the Nautilus floated among those  brilliant sheets of water, and our admiration increased at  seeing the large marine animals play among them like  salamanders. I saw there amidst theii fire that does not  burn, elegant and rapid porpoises, indefatigable clowns of  the sea, and istiophores three yards long, intelligent pre-  cursor of storms, the formidable sword of which struck  against the glass of the saloon ; and then appeared smaller  fish, which streaked the luminous atmosphere in their  course.   This dazzling spectacle was enchanting ! Perhaps some  atmospheric condition augmented the intensity of the  phenomenon. Perhaps some storm was going on above  the waves, but at that depth of a few yards the Nautilus  did not feel its fury, and was peacefully balancing itself  amidst the tranquil waters.   Thus we went on our way, incessantly charmed by some  new marvel. Conseil observed and classified his zoophytes,  his articulates, his molluscs, and his fish. The days fled  rapidly away, and I counted them no longer. Ned, accord-  ing to his custom, tried to vary the fare on board. Veritable  snails, we had become accustomed to our shell, and I  affirmed that it is easy to become a perfect snail. This  existence, then, appeared to us easy and natural, and we  no longer thought of the different life that existed on the  surface of the terrestrial globe, when an event happened  to lecall to us the strangeness of our situation.   On the i8th of January the barometer, which had been  going down for some days, announced an approaching war  of the elements.   I had gone up on to the platform at the moment the  first officer was taking his bearings. I expected as usual  to hear the daily sentence pronounced. But that day it  was replaced by another phrase not less incomprehensible.  Almost immediately I saw Captain Nemo appear and sweep  the horizon with a telescope.   After some minutes he lowered his telescope and ex-  changed about ten words with his officer, who seemed to  be a prey to an emotion that he tried in vain to suppress.   Captain Nemo, more master of himself, remained calm.     136 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   He appeared, besides, to make certain objections, to which  the officer answered by formal assurances at least, I  understood them thus by the difference of their tone and  gestures.   I looked carefully in the direction they were observing  without perceiving anything.   In the meantime Captain Nemo walked up and down the  platform without looking at me, perhaps without seeing me.  His step was firm, but less regular than usual. Some-  times he stopped, folded his arms, and looked at the sea.  What was he seeking in that immense space ? The Nautilus  was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast.   There was something I could not quite understand, of  a disturbing nature. With a nervous air, the first officer  again looked through his telescope, and after a while again  attracted the captain's attention, who stopped his walk  and directed his glasses towards the point indicated. He  observed it for a long time. I, feeling very curious about  it, went down to the saloon and brought up an excellent  telescope that I generally used. Then leaning it against  the lantern cage that jutted in front of the platform, I  prepared to sweep all the line of sky and sea. But I had not  placed my eye to it when the instrument was quickly  snatched out of my hands.   I turned. Captain Nemo was before me, but I hardly  knew him. There was a change in his expression. His  eyes shone with sombre fire under his frowning eyebrows.  His teeth glittered between his firm-set lips. His stiffened  body, closed fists, and head set hard on his shoulders,  showed the violent hatred breathed by his whole appearance.  He did not move. My telescope, fallen from his hand, had  rolled to his feet.   Had I, then, unintentionally provoked his anger ?  Did he think I had robbed him of one of his seciets in the  working of his vessel ?   No ! I was not the object of this display of hatred, for  he was not looking at me ; his eyes remained fixed on the  impenetrable point of the hoiizon.   At last Captain, Nemo recovered his self-possession. His  face, so profoundly excited, resumed its habitual calmness.     UNDER THE SEA 137   He addressed some words in a foreign tongue to his officer,  and then turned towards me again.    M. Aronnax, said he in a rather imperious tone,  I  require from you the fulfilment of one of the engagements  that bind me to you.    What is that, captain ?     To let yourself be shut up you and your companions  until I shall think proper to set you at liberty again.    You are master here, I answered, looking at him  fixedly.  But may I ask you one question ?     No, sir, not one !    After that I had nothing to do but obey, as all resistance  would have been impossible.   I went down to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and  Conseil, and I told them of the captain's determination. I  leave it to be imagined how that communication 4 was  received by the Canadian. Besides, there was no time for  any explanation. Four of the crew were waiting at the  door, and they conducted us to the cell where we had  passed our first night on board the Nautilus.   Ned Land wanted to expostulate, but for all answer the  door was shut upon him.    Will monsieur tell me what this means ?  asked  Conseil.   I related what had happened. My companions were  as astonished as I, and not more enlightened.   I was overwhelmed with reflections, and I could not forget  the expression on Captain Nemo's face. I was incapable  of putting two logical ideas together, and was losing myself  in the most absurd hypotheses, when I was aroused by  these words of Ned Land :    Why, they have laid dinner for us !    In fact, the table was laid. It was evident that Captain  Nemo had given this order at the same time that he caused  the speed of the Nautilus to be hastened.    Will monsieur allow me to recommend something  to him ?  asked Conseil.    Yes, my boy, I replied.    It is that monsieur should eat. It would be prudent,  for we do not know what may happen.     138 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   You are right, Conseil.    Unfortunately, said Ned Land,  they have only  given us the usual fare on board.    Friend Ned, replied Conseil,  what should you say if  you had had no dinner at all ?    That observation cut short the harpooner's grumbling.   We sat down to dinner. The meal was eaten in silence.  I ate little. Conseil forced himself to eat for prudence  sake, and Ned Land ate as usual. Then, the meal over,  we each made ourselves comfortable in a corner.   At that moment the luminous globe that had been lighting  us went out and left us in profound darkness. Ned Land  soon went to sleep, and, what astonished me, Conseil went  oft into a heavy slumber. I was asking myself what  could have provoked in him so great a need of sleep, when I  felt heaviness creep over my own brain. My eyes, which I  wished to keep open, closed in spite of my efforts. I became  a prey to painful hallucinations. It was evident that  soporific substances had been mixed with the food we had  just eaten. Imprisonment, then, was not enough to con-  ceal Captain Nemo's projects from us ; we must have sleep  as well.   I heard the panels closed. The undulations of the sea,  that of a slight rolling motion, ceased. Had the Nautilus,  then, left the surface of the ocean;? Had it again sunk to the  motionless depth ?   I wished to resist sleep. It was impossible. My breath-  ing became weaker. I felt a deathlike coldness freeze and  paralyse my limbs. My eyelids fell like leaden coverings  over my eyes. I could not raise them. A morbid slumber,  full of hallucinations, took possession of my whole being.  Then the visions disappeared and left me in complete  insensibility.   CHAPTER XXIV   THE CORAL KINGDOM   THE next day I awoke with my faculties singularly clear.  To my great surprise I was in my own room. My com-  panions had doubtless been carried to their cabin without     UNDER THE SEA 139   being more aware of it than I. They knew no more what  had happened during the night than I, and to unveil the  mystery I only depended on the hazards of the future.   I then thought of leaving my room. Was I once more  free or a prisoner ? Entirely free. I opened the door, went  through the waist, and climbed the central staircase. The  panels, closed the night before, were opened. I stepped  on to the platform.   Ned Land and Conseil were awaiting me there. I  questioned them ; they knew nothing. They had slept a  dreamless sleep, and had been much surprised to find  themselves in their cabin on awaking.   As to the Nautilus, it was floating on the surface of the  waves at a moderate speed. Nothing on boardseemed  changed.   Ned Land watched the sea with his penetrating eyes.  It was deserted. The Canadian signalled nothing fresh  on the horizon neither sail nor land. There was a stiff  west breeze blowing, and the vessel was rolling under the  influence of long waves raised by the wind.   The Nautilus, after its air had been renewed, was kept  at an average depth of fifteen yards, so as to rise promptly,  if necessary, to the surface of the waves, an operation  which, contrary to custom, was performed several times  during that day of January igth. The second officer then  went up on the platform, and the accustomed sentence was  heard in the interior of the vessel.   Captain Nemo did not appear. Of the men on board I  only saw the impassible steward, who served me with his  usual exactitude and speechlessness.   About 2 p.m. I was in the saloon, occupied in classifying  my notes, when the captain opened the door and appeared.  I bowed to him and he returned the compliment without  uttering a word. I went on with my work, hoping he would  perhaps give me some explanation of the events that had  occurred the previous night. He did nothing of the kind.  I looked at him. His face appeared to me fatigued ; his  reddened eyelids showed they had not been refreshed by  sleep ; his face had an expression of profound and real  grief. He walked about, sat down, rose up, took a book     140 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   at random, abandoned it immediately, consulted his  instruments without making his usual notes, and did not  seem able to keep an instant in peace.   At last he came towards me and said    Are you a doctor, M. Aronnax ?    I so little expected such a question that I looked at him  for some time without answering.    Are you a doctor ?  he repeated.    Yes, I said ; I am doctor and surgeon. I was in  practice for several years before entering the museum.    That is well.   My answer had evidently satisfied Captain Nemo, but  not knowing what he wanted, I awaited fresh questions,  meaning to answer according to circumstances.    M. Aronnax, said the captain,  will you consent to  prescribe for a sick man ?     There is some one ill on board ?     Yes.    I am ready to follow you.    Come.   I must acknowledge that my heart beat faster. I do not  know why I saw some connection between the illness of  this man of the crew and the events of the night before, and  this mystery preoccupied me at least as much as the sick  man.   Captain Nemo conducted me aft of the Nautilus, and  made me enter a cabin situated in the crew's quarters.   There, upon a bed, a man of some forty years, with a face  of the true Anglo-Saxon type, was reposing.   I bent over him . He was not only a sick man but a wound-  edont too. His head, wrapped in bandages, was resting on  a double pillow. I undid the bandages, and the wounded  man, looking with his large fixed eyes, let me do it without  uttering a single complaint.   The wound was horrible. The skull, crushed by some  blunt instrument, showed the brain. The breathing of the  sick man was slow, and spasmodic movements of the muscles  agitated his face.   I felt the pulse ; it was intermittent. The extremities  were already growing cold, and I saw that death was     UNDER THE SEA 141   approaching without any possibility of my preventing it.  After dressing the wound I bandaged it again, and turned  towards Captain Nemo.    How was this wound caused ?  I asked.    What does it matter ?  answered the captain evasively.   A shock of the Nautilus broke one of the levers of the  machine, which struck this man. But what do you think  of his condition ?    I hesitated to reply.    You may speak, said the captain ;  this man does  not understand French.   I looked a last time at the wounded man, then I an-  swered    He will be dead in two hours.    Can nothing save him ?     Nothing.   Captain Nemo clenched his hand, and his eyes filled with  tears.   For some time I still watched the dying man, whose  life seemed gradually ebbing. He looked still paler under  the electric light that bathed his deathbed. I looked at  his intelligent head, furrowed with premature lines which  misfortune, misery perhaps, had long ago placed there. I  tried to learn the secret of his life in the last words that  escaped from his mouth.    You can go now, M. Aronnax, said Captain Nemo.   I left the captain in the room of the dying man, and went  back to my room much moved by this scene. During the  whole day I was agitated by sinister presentiments. I slept  badly that night, and, amidst my frequently-interrupted  dreams, I thought I heard distant sighs and a sound like  funeral chants. Was it the prayer for the dead murmured  in that language which I could not understand ?   The next morning I went up on deck. Captain Nemo  had preceded me there. As soon as he perceived me he  came to me.    Professor, said he.  would it suit you to make a  submarine excursion to-day ?     With my companions ?  I asked.    If they like.     142 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    We are at your service, captain.    Then please put on your diving-dresses.   Of the dying or dead there was no question. I went to  Ned Land and Conseil and told them of Captain Nemo's  proposal. Conseil accepted it immediately and this time the  the Canadian seemed quite ready to go with us.   It was 8 a.m. At half-past we were clothed for our walk,  and furnished with our breathing and lighting apparatus.  The double door was opened, and accompanied by Captain  Nemo, who was followed by a dozen men of the crew, we  set foot at a depth of ten yards on the firm ground where the  Nautilus was stationed.   A slight incline brought us to an undulated stretch of  ground at about fifteen fathoms depth. This ground  differed completely from any I saw during my first excursion  under the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Here there was no  fine sand, no submarine meadows, no seaweed forests. It  was the kingdom of coral that curious substance that  was by turns classified in the mineral, vegetable, and  animal kingdoms. A remedy of the ancients, a jewel of  modern times, it was not until 1694 that it was definitively  placed in the animal kingdom.   Coral is an assemblage of animalculae, united on a poly-  pier of a stony and breakable nature. These polypiers have  a unique generator which produces them by gemmation,  and they possess an existence of their own at the same  time that they participate in the common life. It is, there-  fore, a sort of natural socialism. I knew the result of the  last works made on this strange zoophyte, which mineralises  at the same time that it arborises, according to the very  just observation of naturalists ; and nothing could be more  interesting to me than to visit one of the petrified forests  that Nature has planted at the bottom of the sea.   We followed a coral bank in process of formation, which,  helped by time, would one day close in that portion of the  Indian Ocean. The route was bordered by inextricable  bushes formed by the entanglement of shrubs that the  little white-starred flowers covered. Sometimes, contrary  to the land plants, these bushes, rooted to the rocks, grew  from top to bottom.     UNDER THE SEA 143   The light from our apparatus produced a thousand  charming effects, playing amidst the branches that were  so vividly coloured. It seemed to me as if the membraneous  and cylindrical tubes trembled under the undulation of the  waves. I was tempted to gather their fresh petals, orna-  mented with delicate tentacles, some freshly opened, others  scarcely out, whilst light and rapid-swimming fish touched  them slightly in passing like a flock of birds. But when  my hand approached these living flowers, these animated  sensitive plants, the whole colony was put on the alert.  The white petals re-entered their red cases, the flowers  vanished from my gaze, and the bushes changed into blocks  of stony knobs.   Chance had brought me in presence of the most precious  specimens of this zoophyte. This coral was as valuable as  that found in the Mediterranean, on the coasts of France  and Italy. It justified by its brilliant tints the poetic  names of  Flower of Blood  and  Froth of Blood   which commerce gives to its most beautiful productions.  Coral is sold as high as 10 a pound, and in this place the  liquid masses covered the fortune of a world of coral-dealers.   But soon the bushes contracted. Real petrified thickets  and long galleries of fantastic architecture opened before  our steps. Captain Nemo entered a dark gallery, and we  followed down. Our searchlights sometimes produced  magical effects by following the rough outlines of the  natural arches and pendants, like bushes, which it  pricked with points of fire. Amongst the coralline shrubs  I noticed other polypiers no less curious, melites and  irises with articulated ramifications, also reefs of coral,  some green, some red, like seaweed incrusted in their  calcareous salts, which naturalists, after long discussion,  have definitely classified in the vegetable kingdom. But,  according to the remark of a thinker,  This is perhaps  the real point where life obscurely rises from its stony  sleep, without altogether leaving its rude starting-  point.   At last, after two hours' walking, we reached a depth of  about 150 fathoms that is to say, the extreme limit that  coral begins to form itself. But there it was no longer the     144 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   isolated shrub nor the modest thicket of low brushwood.  It was the immense forest, the great mineral vegetations,  the enormous petrified trees, united by garlands of elegant  sea-bindweed, all decked off with colours and shades. We  passed freely under their high branches lost in the depths  of the water above, whilst, at our feet the tubipores, mean-  drines, stars, fungi, and caryophyllidae formed a carpet of  flowers strewed with dazzling gems.   It was an indescribable spectacle ! Ah, why could we  not communicate our sensations ? Why were we im-  prisoned under these masks of metal and glass ? Why  did we not at least live the life of the fish that people the  liquid element, or rather that of the amphibians who, during  long hours, can traverse as they like the double domain  of land and water ?   In the meantime Captain Nemo had stopped. My  companions and I imitated him, and, turning round, I saw  that his men had formed a semicircle round their chief.  Looking with more attention, I noticed that four of them  were carrying an object of oblong form on their shoulders.   We were then in the centre of a vast open space sur-  rounded by high bushes of the submarine forest. Our  lamps lighted up the space with a sort of twilight which  immoderately lengthened the shadows on the ground. At  the limit of the open space darkness again became pro-  found, and was only  made visible  by little sparks re-  flected in the projections of the coral.   Ned Land and Conseil were near me. We looked on,  and the thought that I was going to assist at a strange scene  came into my mind. As I looked at the ground I saw  that it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences  incrusted with calcareous deposits, and laid out with a  regularity that betrayed the hand of man.   In the centre of the open space, on a pedestal of rocks  roughly piled together, rose a coral cross which extended its  long arms, that one might have said were made of petrified  blood.   Upon a sign from Captain Nemo one of his men came for-  ward, and at the foot of the cross began to dig a hole with  a pickaxe that he took from his belt.     UNDER THE SEA 145   I then understood it all ! This space was a cemetery ;  this hole a grave ; this oblong object the body of the man  who had died during the night ! Captain Nemo and his  men came to bury their companion in this common resting-  place in the depths of the inaccessible ocean !   My mind was never so much excited before. More  impressionable ideas had never invaded my brain! I  would not see what my eyes were looking at !   In the meantime the tomb was being slowly dug. Fish  fled hither and thither. I heard on the soil the ring of the  iron pickaxe that sparkled when it struck some flint lost  at the bottom of the sea. The hole grew larger and wider,  and was soon deep enough to receive the body.   Then the bearers approached. The body, wrapped in a  tissue of white byssus, was lowered into its watery tomb.  The Captain and his crew knelt down all with hands  crossed on their breasts, and I and my two companions  instinctively bent reverently.   The tomb was then filled with the matter dug from the  soil, and when the work was completed, Captain Nemo  and his men rose ; then, collecting round the tomb, all  knelt again, and extended their hands as though bidding  farewell.   Then the funeral procession set out for the Nautilus again,  repassing under the arcades of the forest, amidst the thickets  by the side of the coral-bushes, going uphill all the way.   At last the lights on board appeared. Their luminous  track guided us to the Nautilus. We were back at one  o'clock.   As soon as I had changed my clothes I went up on to the  platform, and, a prey to a terrible conflict of emotions, I  went and seated myself near the lantern-cage.   Captain Nemo joined me there. I rose and said    Then, as I foresaw, that man died in the night ?     Yes, M. Aronnax, answered Captain Nemo.    And now he is resting by the side of his companions  in the coral cemetery ?     Yes, forgotten by every one but us ? We dig the  grave, and the polypi take the trouble of sealing our dead  therein for eternity ?      146 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   And hiding his face in his hand with a brusque gesture,  the captain tried in vain to suppress a sob. Then he  added    That is our peaceful cemetery, at some hundreds of feet  below the surface of the waves !     Your dead sleep, at least, tranquil, captain, out of  reach of the sharks !    Yes, sir, answered Captain Nemo gravely,  of sharks  men 1      PART II   CHAPTER I   THE INDIAN OCEAN   HERE begins the second part of this voyage under the sea.  The first ended with the painful scene at the coral cemetery,  which has left a profound impression on my mind Thus,  then, in the bosom of the immense ocean Captain Nemo's  entire life was passed, and he had even prepared his grave  in the most impenetrable of its depths. There not one  of the ocean monsters would trouble the last slumber of the  inhabitants of the Nautilus of these men, riveted to each  other in death as in life !  Nor man either !  Captain  Nemo had added. There was always in him the same im-  placable and ferocious defiance towards all human society.   I no longer contented myself with the hypotheses that  satisfied Conseil. The worthy fellow persisted in only see,  ing in the commander of the Nautilus one of the unappre-  ciated savants who give back to humanity disdain for indif-  ference. He was still for him a misunderstood genius,  who, tired of the deceptions of the world, had sought refuge  in the inaccessible medium where he could freely exercise  his instincts. But, in my opinion, that hypothesis only  explained one of Captain Nemo's aspects.   In fact, the mystery of that last night during which we  had been enchained in prison and sleep, the precaution so  violently taken by the captain of snatching from my eyes  the telescope ready to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound     UNDER THE SEA 147   of that man due to an inexplicable shock of the Nautilus  all that inclined me in a fresh direction. No ! Captain  Nemo did not content himself with flying from mankind !  His formidable apparatus not only served his instincts of  liberty, but was perhaps also the instrument of terrible  revenge.   Nothing really binds us to Captain Nemo. He knows  that to escape from the Nautilus is impossible. We are  not even prisoners of honour. We are only captives,  disguised under the name of guests by an appearance of  courtesy. Nevertheless, Ned Land has not renounced the  hope of recovering his liberty. It is certain that he will  make a dash for it when the first favourable opportunity  arises. I shall, doubtless, do the same, and yet it will not be  without a sort of regret that I shall part with the mysteries  of the Nautilus. For, after all, is its commander to be  hated or admired ? Is he is a victim or an executioner ?  And, to speak frankly, I should like before leaving him for  ever to have accomplished the submarine tour round the  world of which the beginning has been so magnificent. I  should like to have observed the complete series of marvels  hidden under the seas of the globe. I should like to have  seen what no man has seen before, even if I should pay  with my life for this insatiable desire to learn ! What have  I yet discovered ? Nothing, or nearly nothing, since we  have only yet been over 6,000 leagues of the Pacific.   However I know that the Nautilus is approaching  inhabited lands, and that, if some chance of salvation was  offered to us, it would be cruel to sacrifice my companions  to my passion for the unknown. I must follow them, per-  haps guide them. But will this occasion ever present itself ?   That day, the 2ist of January, 1868, at noon, the first  officer came to take the height of the sun. I went up on to  the platform, lighted a cigar, and followed the operation.  It appeared evident to me that this man did not under-  stand French for several reasons. I made reflections aloud  which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign  of attention if he had understood them, but he remained  impassible and mute.   Whilst he was making his observation with his sextant,   K     148 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   one of the sailors of the Nautilus the vigorous man who  had accompanied us in our first excursion to Crespo Island  came to clean the glass of the lantern. I then examined  the installation of this apparatus, the power of which was  increased a hundredfold by the lenticular rings that were  placed like those of lighthouses, and which kept its light on  a convenient level. The electric lamp was put together so  as to give all its lighting power. Its light, in fact, was pro-  duced in a vacuum which assured its regularity and inten-  sity at the same time. This vacuum also economised the  graphite points between which the luminous arc is developed  a prudent economy for Captain Nemo, who might not  have been able to renew them easily. But in these condi-  tions their absence was almost unnoticeable.   When the Nautilus was prepared to continue her sub-  marine journey, I went down to the saloon. The panels  were closed, and our course was directly west.   We were ploughing through the waves of the Indian Ocean,  a vast liquid plain of 1,200,000,000 acres' extent, the waters  of which are so transparent that they make any one looking  into their depths quite giddy. The Nautilus generally  floated in a depth of between a hundred and two hundred  fathoms. We went on thus for several days. To any other  than myself, who had a great love for the sea, the hours  would have seemed long and monotonous ; but my daily  walks upon the platform, when I acquired new strength in  the reviving air of the ocean, the sight of these rich waters  through the windows of the saloon, reading, and the  compiling of my memoirs, took up all my time, and did  not leave me an idle or weary moment.   The health of all on board kept in a very satisfactory  state. The fare on board suited us perfectly, and, for my  own part, I could have dispensed with the ingenious varia-  tions made through spirit of protestation, by Ned Land.  More, in so constant a temperature there were no colds to  fear.   During several days we saw a great quantity of aquatic  birds, sea-mews, or gulls and palmipeds. Some were  skilfully killed and prepared in a certain way ; they  furnished a very acceptable kind of game. Amongst the     UNDER THE SEA 149   larger varieties, those who fly a long distance from land, and  rest occasionally upon the surface of the water, I noticed  some magnificent albatrosses, whose cry is as discordant as  the bray of an ass. The family of the totipalmates was  represented by the sea-swallows, who quickly caught up the  fish that appeared on the surface of the water ; and by  numerous phaetons, or lepturi, amongst others the phaeton  with red stripes, as large as a pigeon, and whose white  plumage, tinted with red, sets off the black of the wings.   The nets of the Nautilus brought In several kinds of  marine tortoise, with a convex back, the shell of which is  greatly esteemed. These reptiles, who dive easily, can keep  a long time under the water by closing the fleshy safety  valve situated at the external orifice of their nasal canal.  Some of these fish, when taken, were still sleeping in their  shells, sheltered from marine animals. The flesh of these  tortoises was not particularly good, but their eggs made  an excellent dish.   I saw many kinds of fish which I had not before observed.  I shall notice chiefly the ostracions of the Red Sea, the  Indian Ocean, and that part of the ocean which washes the  shores of tropical America. These fish, like the tortoise,  the sea-hedgehog, and the Crustacea, are protected by a  breastplate which is real bone. Sometimes it takes the form  of a solid triangle, sometimes of a solid quadrangle.  Amongst the triangular ones I noticed some of an inch and  a half in length, having wholesome flesh of a delicious  flavour, a brown tail, and yellow fins, and I recommend their  introduction into fresh water, to which a certain number of  sea-fish easily accustom themselves. There were some  quadrangular ostracions that had four large tubercles on  their backs ; some that were dotted over with white spots  on the under side of their bodies, and that could be tamed  like birds ; trigons, provided with spikes formed by the  lengthening of their bony covering, and to which, owing  to their singular grunting, has been given the name of   sea-hogs ;  dromedaries with great humps in the form of  a cone, the flesh of which is hard and leathery.   From the 2ist to the 23rd of January the Nautilus went  at the rate of 250 leagues in 24 hours, or 22 miles an hour.     150 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   The cause of our seeing so many different varieties of fish  was that, being attracted by the electric light, they tried to  accompany us.   On the morning of the 24th, we sighted Keeling Island,  planted with magnificent cocoas, and which has been  visited by Mr. Darwin and Captain Fitz-Roy. The Nautilus  kept along the shores of this desert island for some little  distance. The nets brought up numerous specimens of  polypi and curious shells of mollusca.   Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon and we  directed our course to the north-west, towards the Indian  peninsula.    Civilised land, said Ned Land to me that day.  That  is better than the islands of Papua, where you meet with  more savages than venison ! On that Indian ground, pro-  fessor, there are roads, railways, English, French, or Hindoo  towns. One would not go five miles without meeting with  a countryman. WeU, is it not the moment to take French  leave of Captain Nemo ?     No, Ned, no, I answered in a very determined tone.   Let us see what comes of it. The Nautilus is getting  nearer the inhabited continents. It is going back towards  Europe ; let it take us there. Once in our own seas, we  shah 1 see what prudence advises us to attempt. Besides, I  do not suppose that Captain Nemo would allow us to go and  shoot on the coasts of Malabar or Coromandel, like he did  in the forests of New Guinea.    Well, sir, can't we do without his permission ?    I did not answer the Canadian, for I did not wish to argue.  At the bottom of my heart I wished to exhaust to the end  the chances of destiny that had thrown me on board the  Nautilus.   From Keeling Island our progress became slower, our  route more varied, and we often went to great depths.  Inclined planes, which were placed by levers obliquely to the  water-line, were made use of several times. We went thus  about two miles, but without ever ascertaining the greatest  depths of the Indian Ocean, the bottom of which has never  been reached even by soundings of several thousand  fathoms. As to the temperature in the deepest waters, the     UNDER THE SEA 151   thermometer invariably indicated 4 above zero. I ob-  served that the water is always colder on the higher than  on the lower levels of the sea.   On the 25th of January, the ocean being entirely deserted,  the Nautilus passed the day on the surface, beating the  waves with her powerful screw and making them rebound  to a great height. In these conditions the Nautilus more  than ever resembled a gigantic whale ! I passed three-quar-  ters of this day upon the platform. Nothing could be  sighted on the horizon till, about four o'clock, a steamer  appeared, going westward. Her masts were visible for an  instant, but she could not see the Nautilus, as she was too  low in the water. I thought that this steamboat probably  belonged to the P. and O. Company, which runs between  Ceylon and Sydney, touching at King George's Point and  Melbourne.   At 5 p.m., before that short twilight which unites the day  to the night in tropical zones, Conseil and I were aston-  ished by a curious sight. There is a charming animal which  to meet, according to the ancients, was a good omen.  Modern scientists know this mollusc under the name of   argonaut.   Had any one consulted Conseil he would have learnt  from the brave fellow that the branch of molluscs is  divided into five classes, that the first class, that of the  cephalods, of which the subjects are sometimes bare, some-  times testaceous, comprehends two families those of the  dibranches and the tetrabranches, distinguished by the  number of their branches ; that the family of the dibranches  include three classes the argonaut, calamary, and cuttle-  fish ; and that the family of the tetrabranches only contains  a single one the nautilus. If after that nomenclature a  rebellious mind could confuse the argonaut, which is  acetabuliferous that is to say,  bearer of ventilators   with the nautilus, which is tentaculiferous that is to say,   bearer of tentacles  he would have been inexcusable.   There was a shoal of argonauts then travelling along the  surface of the ocean. We could count several hundreds.  They belonged to the species of argonauts which are peculiar  to the Indian Ocean.     152 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   These graceful molluscs moved themselves backwards  along the water by means of a tube through which they  propelled the water which they had already drawn in. Of  their eight tentacles six were long and thin, and were float-  ing on the water, while the two others were rolled up flat and  spread out to the wind like light sails. I could distinctly  see their spiral-shaped and fluted shells justly compared  to an elegant skiff, for these shells carry the animal which  has formed them without its adhering to them.   The argonaut is at liberty to leave its shell, said I to  Conseil,  but it never makes use of its liberty.    That is like Captain Nemo, replied Conseil.  He  has been happy in naming his ship.   The Nautilus floated in the midst of this shoal of mol-  luscs for about an hour. Then I know not what sudden  fright seized them. As if at a signal, every sail was sud-  denly furled, the tentacles folded, the bodies rolled up, the  shells being turned over changed their centre of gravity,  and the whole fleet disappeared under the waves. This  was all instantaneous, and never did the ships of a squadron  manoeuvre with more uniformity.   At this moment night came on suddenly, and the waves,  hardly raised by the breeze, lay peacefully about the Nauti-  lus.   The next day, the 26th of January, we cut the equator  at the eighty-second meridian and entered into the northern  hemisphere.   During this day a formidable shoal of sharks accompanied  us terrible creatures which swarm in these seas and make  them very dangerous.   These were sharks with brown backs, and whitish bellies,  armed with eleven rows of teeth, and having their necks  marked with a great black spot surrounded with white, which  looked like an eye. There were some sharks with rounded  muzzles and marked with dark spots. These powerful  animals often dashed themselves against the windows of the  saloon with an amount of violence that made us tremble.  At such times Ned Land was no longer master of himself.  He was impatient to go to the surface of the water and  harpoon these monsters, especially some that had their     UNDER THE SEA 153   jaws studded with teeth like a mosaic ; and large tiger-  sharks, about six yards long, which particularly provoked  him. But soon the Nautilus increased her speed, and  quickly left behind the most rapid of these monsters.   On the 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay  of Bengal, we frequently met with a horrible spectacle  human lifeless bodies which floated on the surface of the  water ! These were the dead of the Indian villages, drifted  by the Ganges to the open sea, and which the vultures, the  only undertakers of the country, had not yet been able to  devour. But the sharks did not fail to help them in their  horrible task.   About 7 p.m. the Nautilus, half immersed, was sailing  in the midst of a sea of milk. As far as the eye could see  the ocean appeared turned to milk. Was this the effect of  the lunar rays ? No, for the moon being scarcely two days  old was still hidden below the horizon by the rays of the sun.  The whole sky, although illuminated by the sidereal rays,  appeared black by contrast with the whiteness of the waters.   Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as  to the causes of this phenomenon. Happily I was able to  answer him,    This vast extent of white waves, said I,  which is  frequently to be seen in these parts, is called a milk sea.    But, said Conseil,  what is the cause of such an  effect, for this water is not really changed into milk, I sup-  pose ?     No, certainly not. This whiteness which astonishes  you so much is owing to the presence of myriads of luminous  little worms, colourless and gelatinous, no thicker than a  hair, and no longer than the '007 of an inch. Some of these  little animals adhere to one another for the space of several  leagues.    Several leagues ?  cried Conseil.    Yes, my boy, and do not try to compute the number of  a collection. You would not succeed, for, if I am not mis-  taken, certain navigators have floated on these seas of milk  for more than forty miles.   I do not know if Conseil paid any attention to my recom-  mendation, but he appeared lost in profound thought, seek-     154 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   ing, perhaps, to estimate how many '007 of an inch there  are in forty miles. For my own part, I continued to watch  the phenomenon. During several hours the Nautilus fur-  rowed the milky waves with its prow, and I remarked that  it glided noiselessly upon the soapy water as if it was float-  ing in the eddies of foam that the currents and counter-  currents of bays sometimes leave between them.   Towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its ordinary  colour, but behind us, as far as the limits of the horizon, the  sky, reflecting the whiteness of the waves, for a long time  seemed impregnated with the uncertain light of the aurora  borealis.   CHAPTER II   A FRESH PROPOSITION OF CAPTAIN NEMO'S   WHEN the Nautilus returned at noon on the 28th of Febru-  ary to the surface of the sea, we could see land about eight  miles to westward. The first thing I saw was a group ot  mountains about 2,000 feet high, the forms of which were  very peculiar. I found when the bearings had been  taken that we were near the Island of Ceylon, that pearl  which hangs from the ear of the Indian peninsula.   I went to look in the library for a book giving an account  of this island, one of the most fertile on the globe. At this  moment Captain Nemo and the mate appeared. The  Captain glanced at the map, and then turned towards me.    The Island of Ceylon, said he,  is very celebrated for  its pearl fisheries. Would you like to see one of them, M.  Aronnax ?     I should indeed, captain.    Well, that will be easy enough. Only if we see the  fisheries we shall not see the fishermen. The annual work-  ing of the pearl fisheries has not yet begun. But that does  not matter. I will give orders to make for the Gulf of  Manaar, where we shall arrive during the night.   The captain said a few words to his first officer, who went  out immediately. The Nautilus soon returned to her liquid  element, and the manometer indicated that we were at a  depth of thirty feet.     UNDER THE SEA 155   I looked on the map for the Gulf of Manaar ; I found it  by the ninth parallel on the N.W. coast of Ceylon. It was  formed by the little Island of Manaar. In order to reach  it we should have to go up all the western coast of Ceylon.   Professor, then said Captain Nemo,  there are pearl  fisheries in the Bay of Bengal, in the Indian Ocean, in the  seas of China and Japan, in the Bay of Panama and the  Gulf of California, but nowhere are such results obtained as  at Ceylon. We shall arrive a little too soon, no doubt.  The divers do not assemble till March in the Gulf of Manaar,  and there for thirty days they give themselves up to this  lucrative employment. There are about three hundred  boats, and each boat has ten rowers and ten divers. These  divers, divided into two groups, plunge into the sea alter-  nately, diving to a depth of about thirteen yards by means  of a heavy stone, which they hold between their feet, and  a cord fastened to the boat.    Then, said I,  the primitive method is still in use ?     Yes, answered Captain Nemo,  although these   fisheries belong to the most industrious nation in the world,   to England. They were ceded to her by the treaty of   Amiens in 1802.    It seems to me, however, that a diving dress, such as  you use, would be of great service in such an operation.   Yes, for the unfortunate divers cannot remain long  under water. The Englishman Percival, in his voyage to  Ceylon, does speak of a Caffre who remained five minutes  without rising to the surface, but I can hardly believe it.  I know there are some divers who can stay under for fifty-  seven seconds, and some as long as eighty-seven, but these  cases are rare, and when the poor creatures return to the  boats they bleed from ears and nose. I believe the usual  time that divers can stay under is thirty seconds, and during  this time they hasten to fill a small bag with the pearl oysters.  These divers do not live to be old ; their sight becomes  weakened, and their eyes ulcerated ; sores break out on  their bodies, and very frequently they are seized with apo-  plexy at the bottom of the sea.    Ah, said I, it is a miserable occupation, and only  serves for the gratification of vanity and caprice. But tell     156 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   me, captain, what quantity of oysters can one boat take in a  day.    From about forty to fifty thousand. They even say  that in 1814 the English Government, fishing on its own  account, its divers in twenty days' work brought up seventy-  six millions of oysters.    But at least these divers are sufficiently remunerated ?  I asked.    Scarcely, professor. At Panama they only earn one  dollar a week. And they oftener only earn one sol for each  oyster that contains a pearl, and how many they bring up  that contain none !     One sol only to the poor fellows who enrich their mas-  ters ! It is odious !     Thus, then, professor, added the captain,  you and  your companions shall see the oyster-bank of Manaar, and  if by chance some early diver should be found there, we shall  see him at work.    Agreed, captain.    But, M. Aronnax, you are not afraid of sharks ?     Sharks ?  cried I.   This question appeared to me at least a very idle one.    Well ?  continued Captain Nemo.    I confess, captain, that I am not yet quite at home with  that kind of fish.    We are used to them, answered Captain Nemo,  and  in time you will be so also. However, we shall be armed,  and on the road we may have a shark-hunt. So good-bye  till to-morrow, sir, and early in the morning.   This said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon.   Now if you were invited to hunt the bear in the Swiss  mountains you would say,  Very well, we'll go and hunt the  bear to-morrow. If you were invited to hunt the lion in  the plains of the Atlas, or the tiger in the jungles of India,  you would say,  Ah, ah ! It seems we are going to hunt  lions and tigers !  But if you were invited to hunt the  shark in its native element, you would, perhaps, ask time  for reflection before accepting the invitation.   As to me, I passed my hand over my forehead, where  stood several drops of cold sweat.     UNDER THE SEA 157    I must reflect and take time, I said to myself.  To  hunt otters in submarine forests, as we did in the forests of  Crespo Island, is one thing, but to walk along the bottom  of the sea when you are pretty sure of meeting with sharks  is another ! I am aware that in certain countries, especially  in the Andaman Islands, the negroes do not hesitate t3  attack them with a dagger in one hand and a noose in the  other, but I know, too, that many who affront these crea-  tures do not return alive. Besides, I am not a negro, and  if I were a negro, I think a slight hesitation on my part  would not be out of place.   And I began to dream of sharks, thinking of their vast  jaws armed with multiplied rows of teeth, capable of cutting  a man in two. I already felt a sharp pain in my loins. And  then I could not help shuddering at the cool way in which  the captain had made this weird invitation. Any one would  have thought it was only to follow some inoffensive fox !    Good !  thought I.  Conseil will never come, and   that will be an excuse for me not to accompany the captain.   -As to Ned Land, I must acknowledge I did not feel so   sure of his prudence a peril, however great, had always   some attraction for his warlike nature.   I went on reading my book on Ceylon, but I turned over  the leaves mechanically. I saw formidably-opened jaws  between the lines. At that moment Conseil and the Cana-  dian entered, looking calm, and even gay. They did not  know what was waiting them.    Faith, sir, said Ned Land,  your Captain Nemo  whom the devil take ! has just made us a very amiable  offer.    Ah !  I said.  So you know     Yes, interrupted Conseil,  the commander of the  Nautilus has invited us to visit to-morrow, in company with  monsieur, the magnificent fisheries of Ceylon. He did it  handsomely, and like a real gentleman.    Did he not tell you anything more ?     No, sir, answered the Canadian,  except that he had  mentioned the little exurIon to you.    So he did, I said.  And he gave you no detail  about      158 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Nothing, Mr. Naturalist. You will go with us, won't  you ?     I ? oh, of course ! I see it is to your taste, Ned.    Yes, it will be very curious.    Dangerous too, perhaps, I said in an insinuating tone.    Dangerous !  answered Ned Land.  A simple excur-  sion on an oyster-bank dangerous ?    It was evident that Captain Nemo had not thought proper  to awake the idea of sharks in the mind of my companions.  Ought I to warn them ? Yes, certainly, but I hardly knew  how to set about it.    Monsieur, said Conseil to me,  would monsieur be kind  enough to give us some details about the pearl fisheries ?     Upon the way of fishing or upon the incidents that     Upon the fishing, answered the Canadian.  Before  going on to the ground it is well to know what it's like.    Very well ! Sit down, my friends, and I will tell you  what I have just been reading myself.   Ned and Conseil seated themselves on an ottoman, and  the first thing that Ned asked was    Sir, what is a pearl ?     My good Ned, I answered,  to the poet the pearl is a  tear of the ocean ; to the Orientals it is a drop of solidified  dew ; to the ladies it is a jewel of an oblong form, of a glass-  like brilliancy, of. a mother-of-pearl substance, which they  wear on their fingers, their necks, or their ears ; to the  chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of lime,  with a little gelatine ; and, lastly, to naturalists it is simply  an unhealthy secretion of the organ which produces  mother-of-pearl in certain bivalves.    Now, I continued, all those that secrete mother-of-  pearl that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white substance  that lines the interior of their shells are capable of pro-  ducing pearls.    Mussels too ?  asked the Canadian.    Yes, the mussels of certain streams in Scotland, Wales,  Ireland, Saxony, Bohemia, and France.    Good ; I'll pay attention to that in future, answered  the Canadian.    But, I resumed,  the special mollusc which distils     UNDER THE SEA 159   the pearl is the pearl oyster. The pearl is only a concretion  of mother-of-pearl deposited in a globular form. It either  adheres to the shell of the oyster or lies in the folds of the  animal. The pearl adheres to the shell ; it is loose in the  flesh, but it always has a small hard substance, a barren  egg, or a grain of sand for a kernel, around which the pearly  substance deposits itself, year by year, in thin concentric  layers.    Are many pearls found in the same oyster ?  asked  Conseil.    Yes, I answered,  mention has been made of an  oyster, but I cannot help doubting it, which contained no  less than a hundred and fifty sharks.    A hundred and fifty sharks !  cried Ned Land.    Did I say sharks ?  I cried quickly.  I mean a hun-  dred and fifty pearls. Sharks would be nonsense.    Yes, said Conseil.  Will monsieur now tell us how  they extract the pearls ?     They do it in several ways, and very often when the  pearls adhere to the shell the divers pull them off with pin-  cers. But more frequently the oysters are laid upon the  mat -weed which grows on the shore. Thus they die in the  open air, and at the end of ten days they are sufficiently  decomposed. Then they plunge them into large reservoirs  of sea-water, then open and wash them. Now begins the  double work of the sorters. Firstly they separate the layers  of pearl, known in commerce under the name of clear silver,  bastard whites, and bastard blacks ; then they take the  soft cellular substance of the tissues of the oyster, boil it,  and sift it in order to extract the very smallest pearls.    Does the price of these pearls vary according to their  size ?  asked Conseil.    Not only according to their size, answered I,  but  according to their shape, their colour ; their lustre that  is, that brilliant and variegated display of colours which  makes them so charming to the eye. The finest pearls are  called virgin pearls ; they alone are formed in the tissue of  the mollusc ; they are white, often opaque, but sometimes  have the transparency of an opal, and generally have a  spherical or oval form. When they are round they     160 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   are made into bracelets ; when oval into pendants, and,  being the most precious, are sold separately. The pearls  that adhere to the shell of the oyster are more irregular, and  are sold by weight. In the lowest order are classed the  little pearls, known under the name of seed-pearls ; they are  sold by measure, and are used specially for embroideries on  church ornaments.    But, said Ned Land,  the separating of the pearls  according to their size must be a long and difficult process.    Not so ; it is managed by means of eleven sieves, pierced  with a number of holes. The pearls which remain in the sieve  that has from twenty to eighty holes are of the first order ;  those which do not escape through the sieve pierced with a  hundred to eight hundred holes are of the second order ;  and, lastly, the pearls for which they use sieves pierced with  nine hundred to a thousand holes are those called seed  pearls.    That is ingenious, said Conseil,  and I see that the  division and classifying of pearls are done mechanically.  And now can monsieur tell us what these banks of pearl  oysters bring in ?     If we are to believe the book I have just been reading,  the fisheries of Ceylon are worth annually threw millions of  sharks.    Of francs, said Conseil, correcting me.    Yes, of francs ! Three millions of francs, I resumed.   But I believe that these fisheries bring in less now than  they used to do. It is the same with the American fisheries,  which under the reign of Charles V., were worth four millions  of francs, but are now reduced two-thirds. On the whole,  we may estimate at nine millions of francs the annual value  of the pearl fisheries.    But, asked Conseil,  is there not some talk of cele-  brated pearls that have been quoted at a very high price ?     Yes, my boy. They say that Caesar offered to Servillia  a pearl worth 4,800 of our money.    I have even heard tell, said the Canadian,  that a  certain lady of ancient times drank pearls in her vinegar.    Cleopatra, suggested Conseil.    It must have been nasty, added Ned Land.     UNDER THE SEA 161    Detestable, friend Ned, answered Conseil ;  but a  little glass of vinegar that costs 60,000 ; it is a nice price.    I am sorry I did not marry that lady, said the Cana-  dian, moving about his arms in no very reassuring manner.    Ned Land the husband of Cleopatra !  exclaimed Con-  seil.    But I was to have been married, Conseil, answered  the Canadian seriously,  and it was not my fault that I am  still single. I even bought a pearl necklace for my young  woman, Kate Tender, who, after all, went and married some  one else. Well, that necklace did not cost me more than a  dollar and a half, and yet, believe me, professor, the pearls it  was made of would not even have passed through a sieve  with only twenty holes in it.    Those were only artificial pearls, Ned, said I, laughing,   simple glass globules covered with Eastern essence in the  interior.    That Eastern essence must be very dear, answered  the Canadian.    Almost nothing. It is only the silvery substance from  the scales of the whitebait, taken off in the water and  preserved in ammonia. It is of no value.    Perhaps that's the reason Kate Tender married some  one else, answered Ned Land philosophically.    But, said I,  to return to pearls of great value, I do  not think any sovereign has ever possessed one better than  that of Captain Nemo.    This one you mean, said Conseil, pointing to the  magnificent jewel under its glass case.    Certainly I am not mistaken in assigning it a value of  two millions of     Francs !  said Conseil quickly.   ' Yes, said I,  two millions of francs, and I daresay  it only cost the captain the trouble of picking it up.    Eh !  cried Ned Land,  who says that during our ex-  cursion to-morrow we shall not meet with its fellow ?     Bah !  said Conseil.    And why not ?     What use would millions be to us on board the Nauti-  lus ?      162 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    On board, no, said Land ;  but elsewhere.    Oh ! elsewhere 1  said Conseil, shaking his head.    In point of fact, said I,  Ned Land is right. And if  we ever take back to Europe or America a pearl worth  millions, that at least will give great authenticity, and  at the same time a great value, to the account of our  adventures.    I should think so, said the Canadian.    But, said Conseil, who always returned to the instruc-  tive side of things,  is this diving for pearls dangerous ?     No, answered I,  especially if one takes certain pre-  cautions.    What risk can there be, said Ned Land,  except that  of swallowing a few mouthfuls of sea- water ?     You are right, Ned, said I ; then trying to assume  Captain Nemo's careless tone,  are you afraid of sharks,  Ned ?     I !  answered the Canadian,  a harpooner by profes-  sion ! It is my business to laugh at them.    But, said I,  there is no question of fishing them with  a merlin, drawing them up on to the deck of a ship, and  cutting off their tails with hatchets, of cutting them open,  taking out their hearts, and throwing them back into the  sea !     Then it means     Yes precisely.    In the water ?     In the water.    Faith, what a good harpoon ! You know, sir, these  sharks are awkward fellows and badly put together. They  must turn on their stomachs to nab you, and during that  time    Ned Land had a way of saying the word  nab  that  made my blood run cold.    Well, and you, Conseil, what do you think of sharks ?     If monsieur means to face the sharks, replied Conseil,   I do not see why his faithful servant should not face them  with him 1      UNDER THE SEA 163   CHAPTER III   A PEARL WORTH TEN MILLIONS   NIGHT came. I went to bed and slept badly. Sharks  played an important part in my dreams, and I found  the etymology both just and unjust that made requin, the  French for shark, come from the word  requiem.   The next day, at 4 a.m., I was awakened by the steward,  whom Captain Nemo had specially placed at my service. I  rose promptly, dressed, and went into the saloon. Captain  Nemo was waiting for me there.   ' Are you ready to start, M. Aronnax ?    ' I am ready.   ' Then follow me, please.   ' And my companions, captain ?    ' They are waiting for us.   ' Are we to put on our diving dresses ?    ' Not yet. I have not allowed the Nautilus to come too  near this coast, and we are still some way off Manaar Bank ;  but I have ordered the boat to be got ready, and it will  take us to the exact point for landing, which will save us a  rather long journey. It will have on board our diving  dresses, and we shall put them on as soon as our submarine  exploration begins.   Captain Nemo accompanied me to the central staircase,  which led to the platform. Ned and Conseil were there  delighted at the notion of the pleasure party which was being  prepared. Five sailors from the Nautilus, oars in hand,  awaited us in the boat, which had been made fast against  the side.   The night was yet dark. Heavy clouds covered the sky,  and scarcely allowed a star to be seen. I looked towards the  land, but saw nothing but a faint line inclosing three-  quarters of the horizon from south-west to north-west. The  Nautilus having moved up the western coast of Ceylon  during the night, was now on the west of the bay, or rather  gulf, formed by the land and the Island of Manaar.   There under the dark waters stretched the oyster-bank,  an inexhaustible field of pearls, the length of which is more  than twenty miles.   w     164 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Captain Nemo, Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places  in the stern of the boat, and we moved off.   Our course was in a southerly direction. The rowers did  not hurry themselves. I noticed that their vigorous strokes  only succeeded each other every ten seconds, according to  the method in use by the navy. We were silent. What  was Captain Nemo thinking of ? Perhaps of the land that  we were approaching, and which he found too near him.   About half-past five the first streaks of daylight showed  more clearly the upper line of the coast. Flat enough in the  ast, it rose a little towards the south. Five miles still  separated us from it, and the shore was indistinct, owing  to the mist on the water. There was not a boat or a diver  to be seen. It was evident, as Captain Nemo had warned  me, that we had come a month too soon.   At 6 a.m. it became daylight suddenly, with that rapidity  peculiar to the tropical regions, where there is neither dawn  nor twilight. I saw the land distinctly, with a few trees  scattered here and there. The boat neared Manaar  Island ; Captain Nemo rose from his seat and watched the  sea.   At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but it had  but a little distance to fall, for it was scarcely more than a  yard to the bottom, and this was one of the highest points of  the oysterbank.    Now, M. Aronnax, said Captain Nemo,  here we are.  In a month numerous boats will be assembled here, and  these are the waters that the divers explore so boldly. This  bay is well placed for the purpose ; it is sheltered from the  high winds, and the sea is never very rough here. We will  now put on our diving dresses and begin our investigations.   Aided by the sailors, I began to put on my heavy dress.  Captain Nemo and my two companions also dressed them-  selves. None of the sailors from the Nautilus were to  accompany us.   We were soon imprisoned to the throat in our indiarub-  ber dresses and the air apparatus was fixed to our backs by  means of braces. There was no need for the lighting ap-  paratus. Before putting on the copper cap I had asked  Captain Nemo about it.     UNDER THE SEA 165    We shall not require it, said he.  We shall not go to  any great depth, and the solar rays will give us light enough.  Besides, it would be very imprudent to use an electric lan-  tern under these waters ; its brilliancy might unexpectedly  attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of these shores.   As Captain Nemo uttered these words I turned towards  Conseil and Ned Land. But my two friends had already  enveloped their heads in their metal caps, and could neither  hear nor reply.   I had one more question to ask Captain Nemo.    Our weapons ?  I asked  our guns ?     Guns ! what for ? Do not the mountaineers attack the  bear dagger in hand, and is not steel surer than lead ? Here  is a stout blade ; put it in your belt, and we will start.   I looked at my companions. They were armed like us,  and more than this, Ned Land brandished an enormous har-  poon which he had put into the boat before leaving the  Nautilus.   Then, following the example of the captain, I let them put  on my heavy copper helmet, and the air reservoirs were at  once put in activity. Directly afterwards we were landed  in about five feet of water upon a firm sand. Captain Nemo  gave us a sign with his hand. We followed him, and going  down a gentle slope, we disappeared under the waves.   There the ideas which had previously disturbed me left  me. I became astonishingly calm. The ease of my move-  ments increased my confidence, and the strangeness of the  sight captivated my imagination.   The sun already sent a sufficient light under the water.  The least object could be distinctly seen. After ten minutes'  walk we were about sixteen feet under water, and the ground  became nearly level.   On our steps, like snipe in a marsh, rose swarms of fish  which have no other fins than their tails. I recognised the  Javanese, a veritable serpent ten nails long, with pale  stomach, which one could easily mistake for the conger-eel  were it not for the gold stripes on its flanks. In the class of  stromatae, of which the body is very flat and oval, I noticed  parus, with brilliant colour, wearing their dorsal fin like a  scythe, an edible fish, which, salted and dried, forms an        T66 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   excellent dish, known under the name of karawade ; then  tranquebars, the body of which is covered with a scaly  cuirasse, with eight longitudinal flaps.   The progressive elevation of the sun lighted up the mass of  waters more and more. The ground gradually changed.  To the fine sand succeeded a veritable embankment of  rounded rocks, clothed with a carpet of molluscs and  zoophytes. Here, under this clear water, the crab ran with  unparalleled agility, whilst the turtles that frequent the  coasts of Malabar moved slowly amidst the shaking rocks.   About seven o'clock we were at last on the bank where  the pearl oysters breed by millions. These precious molluscs  adhered to the rocks, strongly fastened to them by brown-  coloured byssus that prevents them moving. In that these  oysters are inferior to mussels, for Nature has not refused to  them all faculty of locomotion.   The mother pearl, the valves of which are about equal,  is a rounded thick shell, very rough on the outside. Some  of these shells were foliated and marked with green bands  that radiated from their summit. They belonged to the  young oysters. The others with black and rough surfaces,  ten years old and more, measured as much as five inches  across.   Captain Nemo pointed out this prodigious accumulation,  and I understood that this mine was really inexhaustible,  for the creative force of Nature is greater than the des-  tructive instinct of man. Ned Land, faithful to this instinct,  hastened to fill a net, which he carried at his side, with the  finest of the molluscs.   But we could not stop. We were obliged to follow the  captain, who appeared to choose paths known only to him-  self. The ground rose gradually, and sometimes, when I  raised my arm, it was above the surface of the sea. Then  the level of the bank sank capriciously. Sometimes we  rounded high rocks in the form of pyramids. In their  dark fractures immense lobsters, shrimps and crabs reared  up on their high paws like some war-machine, looked at us  with fixed eyes, and under our feet crawled uncanny  creatures.   At this moment there opened before us a vast grotto,     UNDER THE SEA 167   hollowed in a picturesque cluster of rocks, and carpeted  with seaweed. At first this grotto appeared very dark to  me. The solar rays seemed to die out there in successive  graduations.   Captain Nemo entered. We followed him. My eyes  soon became accustomed to the relative darkness. I saw the  springing of the vault so capriciously distorted, supported  by natural pillars, widely seated on their granitic bases,  like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture. Why did  our incomprehensible guide lead us into the depths of this  submarine crypt ? I should soon know.   After descending a rather steep incline we were at the  bottom of a sort of circular well. There Captain Nemo  stopped and pointed to an object we had not perceived  before.   It was an oyster of extraordinary gigantic dimensions.  It was adhering by its tuft of fibres to a granite slab, and  there it was developing itself in isolation amidst the calm  waters of the grotto. I estimated its weight at 600 Ibs.  and that it contained 30 Ibs. of meat.   Captain Nemo evidently knew of the existence of this  bivalve. It was not the first visit he had paid to it, and I  thought that in conducting us to that place he merely wished  to show us a natural curiosity. I was mistaken. Captain  Nemo had an interest in seeing the actual condition of this  oyster.   The two valves of the mollusc were half-open. The cap-  tain went up to them and put his dagger between them to  prevent them shutting, then with his hand he raised the  membranous tunic, fringed at the border, that formed the  animal's mantle.   There, amidst its foliated pleats, I saw a pearl as large as a  cocoa-nut. Its globular form, perfect limpidity, and ad-  mirable water made it a jewel of inestimable price. Car-  ried away by curiosity, I stretched out my hand to take it,  weigh it, feel it. But the captain stopped me, made a sign  in the negative, and drawing back his dagger by a rapid  movement, he let the two valves fall together.   I then understood the purpose of Captain Nemo. By  leaving this pearl wrapped up in the mantle of the oyster     168 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   he allowed it to grow insensibly. With each year the  secretion of the mollusc added fresh concentric layers to it.  The captain alone knew of this grotto where this admirable  fruit of Nature was ripening ; he alone was raising it, so  to speak, in order one day to transport it to his precious  museum. I estimated its value at ten million of francs at  least.   Ten minutes afterwards Captain Nemo suddenly stopped.   Leaving the grotto, we proceeded to retrace our steps,  when, with a sudden gesture, Captain Nemo signalled us to  squat down near him. The uneasy idea of sharks came into  my mind. But I was mistaken, and this time we had not to  do with any oceanic monster. It was a man, a living man,  a black Indian, a diver, a poor fellow, no doubt, come to  glean before the harvest. I perceived the bottom of his  canoe anchored at some feet above his head. He plunged  and went up again successively. He was attached to the  boat by a rope and tied to his feet was a square-shaped  stone, which made him descend more rapidly to the bottom.  That was all his stock-in-trade. Reaching the bottom about  three fathoms' down, he threw himself on his knees and  filled his bag with oysters picked up at random. Then he  went up again, emptied his bag, put on his stone again,  and recommenced the operation that only lasted thirty  seconds.   The diver did not see us. The shadow of a rock hid us  from him. And, besides, how could a poor Indian ever  suppose that men, beings like him, were there under the  water, watching his movements, and losing no detail of his  work ?   He went up and plunged again several times. He did  not bring up more than ten oysters at each plunge, for he  was obliged to tear them from the bank to which they were  fastened by their strong byssus. And how many of these  oysters for which he risked his life were destitute of pearls I   I watched him with profound attention. His work was  done regularly, and for half an hour no danger seemed to  threaten him. I was, therefore, getting familiar with the  spectacle of this interesting fishery, when, all at once, at the  moment the Indian was kneeling on the ground, I saw him     UNDER THE SEA 169   make a movement of terror, get up, and spring to remount  to the surface of the waves.   I understood his fear. A gigantic shadow appeared above  the unfortunate plunger. It was a shark advancing dia-  gonally, with eyes of fire and open jaws. I was mute with  terror, incapable of making a movement.   The voracious animal, with a vigorous stroke of his fin,  was springing towards the Indian, who threw himself on  one side and avoided the bite of the shark, but not the stroke  of his tail, which, striking him on the chest, stretched him  on the ground.   Within a second or two the shark returned to the charge,  and turning on his back, it was prepared to cut the Indian  in two, when I felt Captain Nemo, who wasfaear me, suddenly  rise. Then, his dagger in hand, he walked straight up to the  monster, ready for a hand-to-hand struggle with him.   The shark, as he was on the point of grabbing the unfor-  tunate diver, observed his fresh adversary, and going over  on to its stomach again, directed itself rapidly towards him.   I still see the attitude of Captain Nemo. Thrown back-  wards, he was calmly waiting for the attack ; when it  dashed at him he threw himself on one side with prodigious  agility, avoided the shock, and thrust his dagger into its  stomach. But that was not the end. A terrible combat  took place.   The blood flowed in streams from the shark's wounds.  The sea was dyed red, and across this opaque liquid I saw  no more until it cleared a little, and I perceived the au-  dacious captain holding on to one of the animal's fins,  struggling hand-to-hand with the monster, belabouring its  body with dagger thrusts without being able to reach the  heart. There was such a commotion in the water that the  eddies threatened to overthrow me.   I wanted to run to the captain's aid. But, nailed down  by horror, I could not move.   I looked on spell-bound. I saw the phases of the struggle  change. The captain fell on the ground, overthrown by  the enormous mass that was bearing him down. Then the  jaws of the shark opened ready to devour its prey, and all  would have been over for the captain, if, prompt as thought,     i;o TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   harpoon in hand, Ned Land, rushing towards the shark, had  not struck it with its terrible point. More than ever the  water was agitated by the movements of the shark that  beat it with indescribable fury. Ned Land had not missed  his aim. It was the death-rattle of the monster. Struck  in the heart, it struggled in fearful spasms, the rebound of  which knocked over Conseil.   In the meantime Ned Land had set free the captain, who  rose unhurt, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the  cord which fastened him to the stone, took him in his arms,  and with a vigorous throw, he went up to the surface of the  sea. We all three followed him, and scrambled into his  boat.   Upon being vigorously rubbed down the native gradually  returned to consciousness. He opened his eyes. What  must have been his surprise, terror even, at seeing four  large brass heads leaning over him ! And, above all, what  must he have thought when Captain Nemo, drawing from  a pocket in his garment a bag of pearls, put it into his hand 1  This magnificent gift from the man of the sea to the poor  Indian of Ceylon was accepted by him with a trembling  hand. His frightened eyes showed that he did not know to  what superhuman beings he owed at the same time his  fortune and his life.   At a sign from the captain we went back to the oyster  bank, and following the road we had aheady come along,  half-an-hour's walking brought us to the anchor that  fastened the boat of the Nautilus to the ground.   Once embarked, we each, with the help of the sailors,  took off our heavy diving apparatus.   Captain Nemo's first word was for the Canadian.    Thank you, Land, he said.    It was by way of retaliation, captain, answered Ned  Land.  I owed it you.   A pale smile glided over the captain's lips, and that was  all.    To the Nautilus, he said.   The boat flew over the waves. Some minutes later we  met with the floating body of the shark. Its length was  more than twenty-five feet ; its enormous mouth took     UNDER THE SEA 171   up a third of its body. It was an adult ; that was seen by  its six rows of teeth placed in triangular fashion on the upper  jaw.   While I was contemplating the inert mass, a dozen of  these voracious monsters appeared all at once round the  boat ; but, without taking any notice of us, they rushed to-  wards the carcass and disputed the pieces.   At half-past eight we were back on board the Nautilus.   Then 1 began to reflect on the incidents of our excursion  to the Manaar Bank. Two observations naturally resulted  from it. One was upon the unparalleled audacity of Cap-  tain Nemo, the other was his devoting his own life to saving  a human being, one of the representatives of that race he  was flying from under the seas. Whatever he might say,  that man had not succeeded in entirely killing his own  heart.   When I said as much to him, he answered me in a slightly  moved tone    That Indian, professor, is an inhabitant of an oppressed  country, and, until I breathe my last, I am also.     CHAPTER IV   THE RED SEA   DURING the day of the 2Qth of January the Island of Cey-  lon disappeared upon the horizon, and the Nautilus glided  amongst that labyrinth of canals that separate the Mal-  dives from the Laccadives.   We had then made 16,220 miles since our starting-point  in the seas of Japan.   The next day the 30th of January when the Nautilus  went up to the surface of the ocean, there was no longer  any land in sight. It was directing its course towards that  Sea of Oman, situated between Arabia and the Indian penin-  sula, into which the Persian Gulf flows.   Where was Captain Nemo taking us ? I could not tell.  That did not satisfy the Canadian. He asked me that  day where we were going.     172 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    We are going where the captain pleases, Ned.    That can't be far, answered the Canadian.  The  Persian Gulf has no outlet, and if we enter it we shall soon  have to come back.    Well, we must, Mr. Land ; and if, after the Persian  Gulf, the Nautilus wishes to visit the Red Sea, the straits  of Bab-el-Mandeb are there for it to go through.    I need not inform you, sir, answered Ned Land,  that  the Red Sea is as much shut up as the gulf, seeing the  Isthmus of Suez has not yet been pierced j and even if it  were, a vessel as mysterious as ours would not venture into  its canals cut up with locks. So the Red Sea is not yet the  road to Europe.    I did not say that we were going to Europe.    What do you suppose, then ?     I suppose ,that after visiting the shores of Egypt and  Arabia, the Nautilus will go down the Indian Ocean again,  so as to reach the Cape of Good Hope.    And once at the Cape of Good Hope, what then ?   asked the Canadian, singularly persistent.    Well, we shall then go into the Atlantic, which we  don't know yet. Why, Ned, are you tired, then, of your  voyage under the sea ? Are you wearied of the incessantly  varied spectacle of submarine marvels ?     But do you know, M. Aronnax, that we shah 1 soon  have been three months imprisoned on boardthis Nautilus ?     No, Ned, I don't know, I don't want to know, and I  neither count the days nor hours.    But how is it to end ?     The end will come in its own good time. Besides, we  can't do anything, and we are arguing uselessly. If you  came to me and said, ' There is now a chance of escape,'  I would discuss it with you. But such is not the case, and  to tell you the truth, I do not believe Captain Nemo ever  ventures into European seas.   By this short dialogue it will be seen that I was so fond of  the Nautilus that I rowed in the same boat as its com-  mander.   As to Ned Land, he ended the conversation by these  words in a sort of monologue :     UNDER THE SEA 173    All that is very well, but in my opinion where dis-  comfort begins pleasure ends.   On the 6th of February the Nautilus was floating in sight  of Aden, perched on a promontory which a narrow isthmus  joins to the continent, a sort of inaccessible Gibraltar  that the English fortified afresh after taking it in 1839.   The next day, we entered the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb,  the name of which means  Gate of Tears  in Arabic. It  is twenty miles wide, and only thirty long, and for the  Nautilus, at full speed, it was hardly the business of an  hour. But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim,  with which the British Government has fortified the position  of Aden. Too many steamers ploughed the narrow passage  for the Nautilus to venture to show itself. So it kept pru-  dently at a good depth. At last, at noon, we were in the  Red Sea.   The Red Sea, the celebrated lake of Biblical traditions,  that rains scarcely refresh, that no important river waters,  that an excessive evaporation pumps incessantly, and that  loses each year a slice of liquid a yard and a half deep ;  a singular gulf which, if inclosed like a lake, would perhaps  be entirely dried up.   This Red Sea is only 600 kilometers long by 240 wide  andl could not understand why Captain Nemo ventured here.   The Nautilus went at-an average speed, sometimes keeping  on the surface, sometimes plunging to avoid some ship.   Then the Nautilus went nearer the African shores, where  the depth of the sea is greater. There, in water of crystal-  like limpidity, through the open panels we were allowed to  contemplate admirable bushes of brilliant coral, and vast  rocks clothed with a splendid fur of seaweeds and fucus.   What an indescribable spectacle ! and what a variety of  sites and landscapes did the volcanic islets and reefs  make on the Lybian coast ! But it was on the eastern  banks that the arborisations appeared in all their beauty.  It was on the coasts of Tehama, for there not only did terraces  of zoophytes flower below the surface of the waves, but they  formed picturesque banks for ten fathoms above, more  capricious, though less highly coloured, than those that the  humid vitality of the water kept so fresh.     174 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   What charming hours I passed thus at the saloon windows!  What new specimens of submarine flora and fauna I ad-  mired in the brilliant light of our electric lantern !   Here it was that I first gazed on the sponge in its natural  state. Sponge is not a vegetable, as some naturalists  still say, but an animal of the last order, a poly pier inferior  to coral. Its animality is not doubtful, and we may admit  the opinion of the ancients, who looked upon it as an  intermediary between plants and animals.   The class of spongiaires contains about three hundred  species, which are met with in many seas, and even in cer-  tain rivers, where they have received the name of  flu-  viatiles. But the waters they prefer are those of the  Mediterranean, the Grecian Archipelago, the coasts of  Syria and the Red Sea. There are produced and grow the  fine soft sponges that are sometimes worth 5.   In the Red Sea grew sponges of all forms, pedicular,  foliated, globular, digitated. They exactly justified the  names of basket, chalice, spindle, elk-horn, lion's-foot,  peacock's-tail, Neptune's-glove, which divers, more poetic  than savants, have given them. From their fibrous tissue,  coated with a half-fluid gelatinous substance, little streams  of water incessantly escaped, which, after having carried  life into each cell, were expulsed from them by a con-  tractile movement. This substance disappears after the  death of the polypus, and putrefies, whilst it gives off  ammonia. All that then remains are the gelatinous fibres  of which the domestic sponge is composed, that become red-  dish, and are used for different purposes, according to their  quality.   On the loth of February, at noon, I was taking an airing  on the platform when the Captain appeared, and simulta-  neously a determination entered my mind not to let him go  down again without having at least made an attempt to  ascertain his ulterior projects. He saluted me as soon as  he saw me, gracefully offered me a cigar, and said    Well, professor, does this Red Sea please you ? Have  you sufficiently observed the marvels it covers, its fish,  zoophytes, beds of sponge, and forests of coral ? Have  you caught sight of the towns on its shores ?      UNDER THE SEA 175    Yes, captain, I answered,  and the Nautilus has  helped much in the study. Ah, it is an intelligent vessel !     Yes, sir, intelligent, audacious, and invulnerable !  It neither dreads the terrible tempests of the Red Sea, nor  its currents, nor its reefs.    In fact, said I,  this sea is considered one of the  worst, and, if I am not mistaken, its renown in ancient  history was detestable.    Detestable, M. Aronnax ? Greek and Latin historians  do not speak in its praise. They have related that ships  perished in great numbers on its sandbanks, and that no one  dare venture to sail on it at night. They have described  it as a sea subject to frightful tempests, strewn with inhos-  pitable islands, and that ' offers nothing good,' either in  its depths or on its surface.    It is easy to see, I replied,  that these historians have  not been on board the Nautilus.    Yes, answered the captain, smiling,  and in that  respect the moderns are not better off than the ancients.  It took many centuries to find out the mechanical power  of steam ! Who knows if in a hundred years there will be  a second Nautilus ? Progress is slow, M. Aronnax !     That is true, I answered ;  our vessel is a century,  perhaps several, in advance of its epoch. What a misfor-  tune it is that such a secret must die with its inventor !    Captain Nemo did not answer. After a short silence    You were speaking, said he,  of the opinion of ancient  historians on the dangers of navigating the Red Sea ?     That is true, I answered,  but were not their fears  exaggerated ?     Yes and no, M. Aronnax, answered Captain Nemo,  who seemed to know the Red Sea thoroughly. ''What  is no longer dangerous for a modern vessel, well rigged,  solidly built, master of its direction, thanks to obedient  steam, offered perils of all sorts to ancient boats. We must  picture to ourselves those first navigators adventuring in  their barks, made of planks tied together with palm cords  calked with resin, and lubricated with the fat of dog-fish.  They had not even the instruments necessary to take their  bearings, and they went by currents which they knew very     176 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   little of. In such conditions shipwrecks were necessarily  numerous. But in our own time the steamers that run be-  tween Suez and the South Seas have nothing to fear from  the dangers of this gulf, in spite of contrary monsoons.  Their captains and passengers do not prepare for their  departure by propitiatory sacrifices, and, on their return,  they no longer go ornamented with garlands and gold  bandelettes to thank the gods in a neighbouring temple.    I acknowledge, said I,  that steam seems to have  killed gratitude in the heart of seamen. But, captain, as you  seem to have specially studied this sea, can you tell me  the origin of its name ?     There exist numerous explanations of it, M. Aronnax.  Should you like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the  fourteenth century ?     Yes, I should.    This fantastic man pretends that its name was given  after the passage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished  in the waves that closed over again at the voice of Moses.    I cannot be content with that, I replied.  I must  ask for your personal opinion.   This is it. According to me. M. Aronnax, the Red  Sea is a translation of the Hebrew word ' Edrom,' and  the ancients called it so from the peculiar colouring of its  waters.    But at present I have only seen limpid waves of no  particular shade.    Doubtless ; but as you go towards the bottom of the  gulf you will observe that singular appearance. I remem-  ber seeing Tor Bay as red as blood.    And you attribute that colour to the presence of micro-  scopical animal life ?     Yes. They are purple-coloured creatures, forty thou-  sand of which would only fill the '03937 of a square inch.  Perhaps you will meet with some when we are at Tor.    Then, Captain Nemo, it is not the first time you have  been in the Red Sea on board the Nautilus ?     No, sir.    Then as you spoke just now of the passage of the  Israelites and the catastrophe of the Egyptians, may I ask     UNDER THE SEA 17?   if you have found any traces of that great historical fact  under its waters ?     No, professor, and that for an excellent reason.    What reason ?     That the very spot where Moses and all his people  passed over is now so choked up with sand that camels  can hardly bathe their legs there. You understand that my  Nautilus would not find enough water there.    Where is the spot ?  I asked.    It is situated a little above Suez, in that arm that used  to form a deep estuary when the Red Sea extended to the  Dead Sea. Now, whether this passage was miraculous or  no, the Israelites did pass over it to reach the Promised  Land, and Pharaoh's army perished precisely in the same  spot. I think that if excavations were made in the sand  many arms and instruments of Egyptian origin would be  discovered.    It is evident, I answered,  and it is to be hoped for  the sake of archaeologists that these excavations will be  made sooner or later, when new towns will be built on that  isthmus, after the Suez Canal has been pierced a canal  very useless to such a vessel as the Nautilus 1     Doubtless, but useful to the entire world, said Captain  Nemo.  Unfortunately, he resumed,  I cannot take  you through the Suez Canal, but, nevertheless, the day after  to-morrow I hope to be in the Mediterranean.    In the Mediterranean ?  I cried.    Yes, professor. Does that astonish you ?     What astonishes me is that we shall be there the da  after to-morrow.    Really ?     Yes, captain, although I ought to be accustomed to  being astonished at nothing on board your vessel.    But why are you surprised now ?    At the frightful speed your Nautilus must reach to find  itself to-morrow in full Mediterranean, having made the  tour of Africa and doubled the Cape of Good Hope.    And who told you it would take the tour of Africa,  professor? Who spoke of doubling the Cape of Good  Hope ?      178 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Unless the Nautilus can move over soil and passes  over the isthmus     Or underneath, M. Aronnax.    Underneath ?     Certainly,  answered Captain Nemo tranquilly. ' It  is a long time since Nature has done under that tongue of  land what men are now doing on its surface.    What 1 there exists a passage !    ' Yes, a subterranean passage that I have named Abra-  ham Tunnel. It begins above Suez and ends in the Gulf  of Pelusium.    But the isthmus is only formed of moving sand.    To a certain depth. But at a depth of fifty yards only  there is a stratum of rock.    Would it be indiscreet to ask you how you discovered  this tunnel ?     Sir, answered the captain,  there can be no secret  between people who are never to leave each other again.   I paid no attention to the insinuation, and awaited  Captain Nemo's communication.    Professor, said he,  it was a naturalist's reasoning  that led me to discover this passage, which I alone know  about. I had noticed that in the Red Sea and the Mediter-  ranean there existed a certain number of fish of absolutely  identical species. Certain of this fact, I asked myself if  there existed no communication between the two seas. If  one did exist, the subterranean current must necessarily  flow from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean on account of  the different levels. I therefore took a great number of  fish in the neighbourhood of Suez. I put a brass ring on  their tails, and threw them back into the sea. A few  months later, on the coast of Syria, I again took some speci-  mens of my fish with their tell-tale ornaments. The com-  munication between the two seas was then demonstrated.  I looked for it with my Nautilus, discovered it, ventured  into it, and before long, professor, you too will have been  through my Arabic tunnel.     UNDER THE SEA 179  CHAPTER V   THE ARABIAN TUNNEL   THAT day I repeated to Conseil and Ned Land the part  of this conversation in which they were directly interested.  When I told them that in two days' time we should be in  the midst of the waters of the Mediterranean, Conseil  clapped his hands, but the Canadian shrugged his shoulders.    A submarine tunnel !  he cried ; a communication  between the two seas ! Who ever heard of such a thing ?     Friend Ned, answered Conseil,  had you ever heard  of such a thing as the Nautilus ? No. Yet it exists. So  don't shrug your shoulders so easily, and laugh at things  because you have never heard of them before.    We shall see, answered Ned Land, shaking his head.   After all, I want to believe in this captain's passage, and  Heaven grant that it may take us into the Mediterranean !    We were submerged, while travelling along the Arabian  coast, until the loth of February, when at noon, the sea  being deserted, the Nautilus went up to the sea level.   Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I went to sit down  on the platform. The coast on the east was enveloped by a  damp fog.   Leaning on the sides of the vessel, we were talking about  various things, when Ned Land noticed something on the  waters' surface.    Do you see anything there, professor ?  he asked,  pointing.    Yes, said I, after an examination.  I perceive a  long black body on the surface of the water.    Another Nautilus ?  said Conseil.    No, answered the Canadian,  but I am much mis-  taken if it is not some marine animal.    Are there any whales in the Red Sea ?  asked Conseil.    Yes, my boy, I answered.  They are met with here  sometimes.    It is not a whale, said Ned Land, who did not lose  sight of the object signalled.  Whales and I are old  acquaintances, and I could not be mistaken.   M     x8o TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Wait, said Conseil.  The Nautilus is going towards  it, and before long we shall know what to think about it.   The long black object was soon not a mile from us. It  looked like a great rock deposited in the open sea.   Ah, it is moving ! it plunges !  cried Ned Land.   What animal can it be ? It has not even a forked tail  like whales.    Then  began I.    It is on its back now, resumed the Canadian,  and  it raises its udders in the air.    It's a syren, cried Conseil,  a veritable syren !    The name of syren set me on its track, and I understood  that this animal belonged to the order of marine animals  of which fable has made syrens half women, half fishes.    No, said I to Conseil,  it is not a syren, but a curious  animal of which there only remains a few specimens in the  Red Sea. It is a dugong.   Ned expressed a desire to harpoon it. His eyes shone  covetously at the sight of this animal.    Oh, sir !  he said in a voice trembling with emotion,   I have never killed anything of that kind.   At that instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform.  He espied the dugong, understood the Canadian's attitude,  and said to him    If you held a harpoon, Mr. Land, would it not burn  your hand ?     That it would !     And you would not be sorry to take up your old trade  again for one day, and add that monster to the list of those  you have already struck ?     No, I shouldn't be sorry.    Well, you may try.    Thank you, sir, answered Ned Land, with eyes aflame.    Only, continued the captain,  I advise you, in youi  own interest, not to miss that animal.    Is the dugong dangerous to attack ?  I asked, in spite  of the Canadian's contemptuous shrug.    Yes, sometimes, answered the captain.  That  animal turns on its assailants and wrecks their boats. Bui  for-Ned Land that danger is not to be feared. His glance is     UNDER THE SEA 181   prompt, his hand sure. If I recommend him not to miss  the dugong it is because it is justly considered fine game,  and I know that Ned Land likes good meat.    Ah !  said the Canadian,  so that animal gives  himself the luxury of being good to eat ?     Yes, Mr. Land. Its flesh, a veritable meat, is much  esteemed, and in this part of the world it is kept for princes'  tables. It is so much hunted, that it becomes more and  more rare.    Then, sir captain, said Conseil seriously,  if this one  should be the last of its race, ought it not, in the interest of  science, to be spared ?     Perhaps, replied the Canadian ;  but in the interest  of our table it is better to pursue it.   Do it, then, Mr. Land, answered Captain Nemo.   At that moment seven of the crew, mute and impassible  as usual, came upon the platform. One was carrying a  harpoon and a line similar to those employed by whale-  fishers. The deck was taken off the boat, which was lifted  from its niche and thrown into the sea. Six rowers took  their places on the seats, and the coxswain at the helm.  Ned, Conseil, and I seated ourselves aft.    Are you not coming, captain ?  I asked.    No, sir, but I wish you much success.   The boat, rowed vigorously, went rapidly towards the  dugong, about two miles away.   The dugong was of colossal dimensions, not less than  eight yards long. It was not moving, and seemed to be sleep-  ing on the surface of the water, a circumstance that made  its capture easier.   The boat prudently approached to within three cables'  length of the animal. The oars remained suspended on  their rowlocks. I half rose. Ned Land, standing at the  prow, his body thrown slightly backward, brandished his  harpoon in his experienced hand.   Suddenly a hissing sound was heard and the dugong  disappeared. The harpoon, launched with force, had  doubtless only struck the water.    The devil !  cried the Canadian in a rage.  I have  missed it !      i8 2 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    No, I said,  the animal is wounded ; there is its  blood, but your instrument did not remain in its body.    My harpoon 1 my harpoon !  cried Ned Land.   The sailors rowed vigorously, and the coxswain guided  the boat towards the floating barrel to which the harpoon  was attached. When the harpoon was fished up again the  boat began to pursue the animal.   The dugong came up to the surface of the sea to breathe  from time to time. Its wound had not weakened it, for it  moved along with great rapidity. The boat, rowed by  strong arms, followed on its track. Several times it  approached to within a few cables, and the Canadian made  ready to strike ; but the monster escaped by a rapid plunge,  and it was impossible to reach it.   Ned Land's anger may be imagined. He launched the  most energetic oaths in the English language at the animal.   They pursued it thus without ceasing for an hour, and  I was beginning to believe that it would be very difficult to  catch it, when the animal started to act on the aggressive.   This manoeuvre did not escape the Canadian.    Attention !  said he.   The coxswain pronounced several words in his strange  language, and he was doubtless warning his men to keep on  their guard.   The dugong stopped within twenty feet of the boat, then  breathing sonorously, like a bull before charging, he rushed  upon us.   The boat was half overturned, but, thanks to the skill  of the coxswain, it righted itself.   We were, however, thrown over one another, and no  sooner had we recovered our equilibrium, than we saw the  monster with the gunwhale between its jaws. With great  agility, Ned Land returned to the attack, and whilst it was  viciously gnawing the ironplate of the craft, he harpooned it  time after time. This only added to the fury of the monster  and the adventure would have ended disastrously had not  the Canadian, just when the boat was being lifted out of  the water, driven home a fatal blow. He had pierced its  heart, and the dugong disappeared, to rise again, on its  back, a lifeless mass.     UNDER THE SEA 183   We took it in tow towards the Nautilus and here we had to  use tackle of enormous strength to hoist up the carcass on to  the platform. It weighed 10,000 Ibs. They cut it up under  the eyes of the Canadian, who wanted to follow all the  details of the operation. The same day the steward  served me at dinner with a dugong stake, which I enjoyed  quite as much as though it was the tenderest cut of beef.   The next day, the nth of February, the pantry of the  Nautilus was enriched by some more delicate game. A  flight of sea-swallows swooped down on the Nautilus. It  was a species peculiar to Egypt, the beak of which is black,  the head grey and speckled, the eye surrounded with white  dots, the back, wings, and tail grey, the stomach and  throat white, the legs red. They also took some dozens of  Nile ducks, wild birds of delicious flavour, the neck and  back of which are white, with black spots.   The speed of the Nautilus was then moderate. I noticed  that the air and water of the Red Sea became less and less  salty as we drew nearer to Suez.   At 6 p.m. the Nautilus, sometimes floating, sometimes  submerged, passed by Tor, seated on a bay, the waters of  which seemed of a reddish tint, as Captain Nemo had said.  Then night fell in the midst of a deep silence, sometimes  broken by the cries of the pelican and other night birds, the  noise of the waves beating on the rocks, or the far-off  panting of some steamer beating the waters of the gulf with  its paddles.   From eight to nine o'clock the Nautilus kept at some  yards below the water. According to my calculations we  were very near Suez. Through the panels of the saloon I  perceived the rocks lighted up by our electric light. It  seemed to me that the passage grew gradually narrower.   At a quarter-past nine the boat went up again to the  surface, and I ascended to the platform. Impatient to go  through the captain's tunnel I could not keep still, and  wanted to breathe the fresh air of night.   Soon, in the darkness, I perceived a pale light, half-  discloured by the mist, shining about a mile off.    A lightship, said some one near me.   I turned and recognised the captain.     184 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    It is the Suez lightship, he continued.  We shall  not be long before we reach the tunnel.    It cannot be very easy to enter it.    No. And I am in the habit of keeping in the helms-  man's cage to direct the manoeuvre myself. And now, if  you will go down, M. Aronnax, the Nautilus will sink under  the waves, and will not come up to the surface again till it  has been through the Arabian Tunnel.   I followed Captain Nemo. The panels were shut, the  reservoirs of water filled, and the apparatus sank about  thirty feet. As I was about to enter my room the captain  stopped me.    Professor, said he,  should you like to accompany  me in the pilot's cage ?     I dared not ask it of you ?  I answered.    Come, then. You will thus see all that can be seen of  that navigation at the same time subterrestrial and sub-  marine.   Captain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase.  About half-way up he opened a door, went along the upper  waist, and arrived at the pilot's cage, which, my readers  know, rose from one end of the platform.   It was a cabin, six feet square. In the midst was a  wheel, vertically stationed, working into the truss of the  helm that ran as far as the aft of the Nautilus. Four light-  ports, made of lenticular glasses, were fixed in the sides of  the cabin, and allowed the man at the helm to see in every  direction.   This cabin was dark.but my eyes soon became accustomed  to the obscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a vigorous man,  whose hands were leaning on the fellies of the wheel.  Outside the sea seemed brilliantly lighted up by the lantern  that was shining behind the cabin at the other extremity  of the platform.    Now, said Captain Nemo,  we must seek our passage.'   Electric wires put the helmsman's cage into communica-  tion withthe engine-room.and from thence the captain could  give simultaneously to his Nautilus both direction anj  movement. He pressed a metal knob, and immediately  the speed of the screw was reduced.     UNDER THE SEA 185   I watched in silence the high wall that we were moving  along at that moment ; it was the immovable foundation  of the sand-bed on the coast. We followed it thus for an hour,  keeping parallel with it at a yard or so distant only. Captain  Nemo did not look away from the compass, hung by two  concentric circles in the midst of the cabin. At a sign the  helmsman modified every instant the direction of the  Nautilus.   At 10.15 p.m. Captain Nemo took the helm himself. A  wide gallery, black and deep, opened before us. The  Nautilus entered it boldly. An unaccustomed rumbling  was heard along the sides. It was the waters of the Red  Sea that the slope of the tunnel was precipitating into the  Mediterranean. The Nautihis followed the torrent with the  speed of an arrow, notwithstanding the efforts of the  machine that, in order to resist it, bent the waves backwards.   On the narrow walls of the passage I saw nothing but  brilliant lines, furrows of fire traced by the speed under the  electric light. My heart beat wildly, and I passed my hand  to it to stay its palpitations.   At 10.35 P- m - Captain Nemo let go the helm, and, turn-  ing towards me    The Mediterranean !  said he.   In less than twenty minutes the Nautilus, carried along  by the torrent, has cleared the Isthmus of Suez.     CHAPTER VI   THE GRECIAN ARCHIPELAGO   THE next day, the I2th of February, at daybreak, the  Nautilus went up to the surface of the sea and I ascended  the platform. There Ned and Conseil joined me. These  two inseparable companions had slept tranquilly, thinking  no more of the Nautilus' feat.    Well, Mr. Naturalist, asked the Canadian in a slightly  jeering tone,  what about the Mediterranean ?    We are on its surface, friend Ned.  What! said Conseil, last night      186 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Yes, last night itself, in a few minutes, we cleared the  insuperable isthmus.    I don't believe it, said the Canadian.    And you are wrong, Land, I resumed.  The low  coast rounding off towards the south is the Egyptian coast.    You won't take me in, said the obstinate Canadian.    But it must be true, said Conseil,  or monsieur would  not say so.    Besides, Ned, Captain Nemo personally navigated the  tunnel, and I was near him in the helmsman's cage whilst he  guided the Nautilus through the narrow passage.    You hear, Ned ?  said Conseil.    And you who have such excellent eyesight, I added   you, Ned, can see the piers of Port Said stretching out  into the sea.   The Canadian looked attentively.    Yes, said he,  you are right, professor, and your  captain is a clever man. We are in the Mediterranean.  Good. Well, now let us talk, if you please, about our own  concerns, but so that no one can hear.   I saw very well what the Canadian was coming to. In  any case I thought it better to talk about it, as he desired,  and we all three went and sat down near the lantern- house,  where we were less exposed to the spray from the waves.    Now, Ned, we are ready to hear you, said I.  What  have you to tell us ?     What I have to tell you is very simple, answered  the Canadian.  We are in Europe, and before Captain  Nemo's caprice drags us to the bottom of the Polar Seas, or  takes us back to Oceania, I want to leave the Nautilus.   I must acknowledge that a discussion with the Canadian  on the subject always embarrassed me.   I did not wish to trammel the liberty of my companions  in any way, and yet I felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.  Thanks to him and his apparatus, I was each j day completing  my submarine studies. Should I ever again meet with such  an opportunity of observing the marvels of the ocean ?  No, certainly. I could not, therefore, reconcile myself to  the idea of leaving the Nautilus before my investigations  were completed.     UNDER THE SEA 187    Friend Ned, I said,  answer me frankly. Are you  dull here ? Do you regret the destiny that has thrown you  into the hands of Captain Nemo ?    The Canadian remained for some moments without  answering. Then crossing his arms    Frankly, he said,  I do not regret this voyage under  the seas. But it must come to an end. That is my opinion.    It will come to an end, Ned.    Where and when ?     I do not know where, and I can't say when, or rather  I suppose it will end when these seas have nothing further  to teach us. All that begins has necessarily an end in this  world.    I think like monsieur, answered Conseil,  and it is  quite possible that after going over all the seas of the globe  Captain Nemo will give us our discharge.    Our discharge !  cried the Canadian.  A drubbing  you mean !     We must not exaggerate, Land, I resumed.  We  have nothing to fear from the captain, but I am not of  Conseil's opinion either. We are acquainted with the  secrets of the Nautilus, and I have no hope that its com-  mander, in order to set us at liberty, will resign himself  to the idea of our taking them about the world with us.    Then what do you expect ?  asked the Canadian.    That, within six months' time, circumstances will  happen of which we can and ought to take advantage.    Phew !  said Ned Land.  And where shall we be in  six months, if you please, Mr. Naturalist ?     Perhaps here, perhaps in China. You know that the  Nautilus is a quick sailer. It does not fear frequented  seas. How do v/e know that it will not rally round the  coasts of France, England, or America, where we can  attempt to escape as advantageously as here ?     M. Aronnax, answered the Canadian,  your premises  are bad. You speak in the future tense : ' We shall be  there ! we shall be here ! ' I speak in the present : ' We  are here, and we must take advantage of it.   I felt that Ned Land's logic was sound. I no longer  knew what arguments to use     188 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Sir, Ned went on,  let us suppose, for the sake of  argument, that Captain Nemo were to offer you your  liberty to-day, should you accept it ?     I do not know, I replied.    And if he were to add that the offer he makes to-day  he would, not renew later on, should you accept ?    I did not answer.    And what do you think about it, friend Conseil ?   asked Ned Land.    I have nothing to say. I am absolutely disinterested  in the question. I am at monsieur's service. I think like  monsieur, I say what monsieur says, and you must not de-  pend upon me to make a majority. Two persons only are  concerned ; monsieur on one side, Ned Land on the other.  That said, I listen, and am ready to count for either.    Then, sir, said Ned Land,  as Conseil does not exist,  we have only to speak to each other. I have spoken, you  have heard me. What have you to answer ?    It was evident that I must sum up, and subterfuges were  repugnant to me.    Friend Ned, I said,  this is my answer. You are  right and I am wrong. We must not depend upon Captain  Nemo's goodwill. On his part, prudence forbids him to set  us at liberty. On the other hand, prudence tells us that we  must profit by the first opportunity of leaving the Nautilus.    Very well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely spoken.    Only, I said,  I have but one observation to make  the occasion must be serious. Our first attempt must  succeed, for if it fail we shall not find another opportunity  of attempting it again, and Captain Nemo would not forgive  us.    That's true enough, answered the Canadian.  But  your observation applies to every attempt at flight, whether  it be made in two years' or two days' time. Therefore the  question is still the same ; if a favourable opportunity  occurs, we must seize it.    Agreed. And now, friend Ned, will you tell me what  you mean by a favourable opportunity ?     For instance, a dark night when the Nautilus would be  only a short distance from some European coast.     UNDER THE SEA 189    Then you would attempt to escape by swim-  ming ?     Yes, if we were sufficiently near the coast, and the  vessel were on the surface ; but if we were far off, or if the  vessel were under water     And in that case ?     In that case I should try to take possession of the boat.  1 know how it is worked. We would get into the interior  of it, undo the bolts, and get up to the surface without  even the helmsman seeing us.    Well, Ned, look out for that opportunity ; but do not  forget that a failure would be fatal to us.    I will not forget it, sir.    And now, Ned, should you like to know what I think  of your plan ?     Yes, M. Aronnax.    Well, I think I do not say I hope that so favourable  an opportunity will not occur.    Why ?     Because Captain Nemo cannot be unaware that we have  not renounced the hope of recovering our liberty, and will  keep watch above all in European seas.    I am of monsieur's opinion, said Conseil.    We shall see, answered Ned Land, shaking his head in  a determined manner.    And now, Ned Land, I added,  we must leave it  there. Not another word on this subject. The day you  are ready you will inform us and we shall follow you. I  leave it entirely to you.   This conversation, that was destined to have such grave  consequences later on, ended thus.   The next day, the I4th of February, I was in the saloon  with the Captain. He was busy among his maps, while I,  taking advantage of the panels being open, was engaged in  studying the fish of the archipelago.   I was feasting my eyes on these wonders of the sea, when  suddenly there was a strange apparition. In the midst of  the waters a man appeared, a diver, wearing in his belt a  leather purse. He was swimming vigorously, occasionally  disappearing to take breath on the surface, then plunging     190 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   again immediately. I turned to Captain Nemo, and  exclaimed in an agitated voice    A man 1 a shipwrecked man ! He must be saved at any  price 1    The captain did not answer, but came and leaned against  the window.   The man had approached and, with his face flattened  against the glass, he gazed at us.   To my profound astonishment Captain Nemo made a  sign to him. The diver answered him with his hand ;  immediately went up again to the surface of the sea, and did  not appear again.    Don't be uneasy, said the captain to me.  It is  Nicholas of Cape Matapan, surnamed the Pesce. He is  well known in all the Cyclades. A bold diver ! Water is  his element, and he lives in it more than on land, going  constantly from one island to another, and even as far as  Crete.    Do you know him, captain ?     Why not, M. Aronnax ?    That said, Captain Nemo walked to an iron safe, on the  lid of which was a brass plate bearing an inscription of the  initial of the Nautilus, and its motto,  Mobilis in Mobile.   Regardless of my presence he opened the safe, taking no  precaution at secrecy and I noticed that it was packed with  ingots of gold. From whence came this precious metal that  represented an enormous sum ? And what was he going to  do with it ?   I did not speak a word. I looked. Captain Nemo took  these ingots one by one, and rearranged them. I estimated  that the safe contained more than 2,000 Ibs. weight of gold  that is to say, nearly 200,000.   The safe was securely fastened, and the captain wrote  an address on the lid in what must have been modern Greek  characters.   This done, Captain Nemo'pressed a knob, the wire of which  communicated with the quarters of the crew. Four men  appeared, and, not without some trouble, pushed the  safe out of the saloon. Then I heard them pulling it up the  iron staircase with pulleys.     UNDER THE SEA 191   Then Captain Nemo turned to me.    Did you speak, professor ?     No, captain.    Then, sir, if you allow me, I will wish you good-night.    Upon which Captain Nemo left the saloon.   I went back to my room very curious, as may be imagined.  I tried in vain to sleep. I tried to find what connection  there could be between the diver and the safe filled with  gold. I soon felt by its pitching and tossing that the  Nautilus was back on the surface of the water.   Then I heard a noise of steps on the platform. I under-  stood that they were unloosening the boat and launching it  on the sea. It struck for an instant against the sides of the  Nautilus, and then the noise ceased.   Two hours afterwards the same noise, the same move-  ments, were repeated. The boat, hoisted on board, was  replaced in its socket, and the Nautilus sank again under  the waves.   Thus, then, the gold had been sent to its address. To  what point of the continent ? Who was Captain Nemo's  correspondent ?   The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the  events of the preceding night, which had excited my  curiosity to the highest pitch. My companions were no  less surprised than I.    But where does he find all that gold ?  asked Ned Land.   To that there was no convincing answer. I went to the  saloon after breakfast and began to work. Feeling unusually  warm, I took off my coat. It gradually became warmer,  and in fact it was so intolerably hot, that I was disturbed in  mind.    Can the vessel be on fire ?  I asked myself.   I was going to leave the saloon when Captain Nemo en-  tered. He approached the thermometer, corrected it, and  said    Forty-two degrees  (centigrade).    I feel it, captain, I answered, and if the heat augments  we cannot bear it.    The heat will not augment unless we choose.    Then you can moderate it as you please ?      192 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    No, but I can get away from the focus that produces  it.    Then it is exterior ?     Certainly. We are floating in boiling water.    Is it possible ?  I cried.    Look !    The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white  round the Nautilus. A sulphurous smoke was curling  amongst the waves that boiled like water in a copper. I  placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat  was so great that I was obliged to withdraw it.    Where are we ?  I asked.    Near the Island of Santorin, professor, replied the  captain,  and precisely in the channel that separates Nea-  Kamenni from Pali-Kamenni. I wished to show you the  curious spectacle of a submarine eruption.    I thought, said I,  that the formation of these new  islands was ended.    Nothing is ever ended in volcanic places, replied  Captain Nemo.  The globe is always being worked there  by subterranean fires. See, sir, see the work that is going  on under these waves.   I returned to the window. The Nautilus was no longer  moving. The heat was growing intolerable. From white  the sea was getting red, a coloration due to the presence  of salts of iron. Notwithstanding the saloon's being  hermetically closed, an unbearable sulphurous smell  pervaded it, and I perceived scarlet flames the brilliancy  of which killed the electric light.   I was in a bath of perspiration, choking, and nearly  broiled.    We cannot remain any longer in this boiling water,  I said to the captain.    No, that would not be prudent, answered the un-  moved Nemo.   An order was given. The Nautilus tacked about, and  left the furnace it could not with impunity set at defiance.  A quarter of an hour later we were breathing on the surface  of the waves.   The thought then occurred to me that if Ned Land had     UNDER THE SEA 193   chosen that part of the sea for our flight we should not have  come out of it alive.     CHAPTER VII   THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS   THE Mediterranean, bordered with orange-trees, aloes,  cactus, maritime pines, made fragrant with the perfume of  myrtles, framed in rude mountains, saturated with a pure  and transparent air, but incessantly worked by under-  ground fires, is a perfect battle-field, in which Neptune and  Pluto still dispute the empire of the world. But, although  it is so beautiful, I could only take a rapid glance at its  basin, which covers a superficial area of two millions of  square kilometers. Even Captain Nemo's knowledge  was lost to me, for the enigmatical personage did not once  appear during our rapid passage. I estimated at about  six hundred leagues the course of the Nautilus under the  waves of this sea, and it accomplished this voyage in forty-  eight hours. Starting on the morning of the i6th of Feb-  ruary from the Grecian seas, we had cleared the Straits of  Gibraltar by sunrise on the i8th.   It was evident to me that this Mediterranean, inclosed by  the countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful  to Captain Nemo. Its waves and breezes recalled too many  memories, if not too many regrets. He had not here that  liberty of movement, that independence of manoeuvre,  that he had elsewhere, and his Nautilus was cramped  between the shores of Africa and Europe.   Our apparatus only went up to the surface at night in  order to renew its provision of air, and it was guided  entirely by the compass and log.   Of the various fish in the opulent waters of the Mediter-  ranean I could only get a glimpse, on account of the un-  usually bewildering speed of the Nautilus. Prominent  among the species were lampreys, a yard long ; a sort of  skate, five feet wide, with white belly and grey spotted  back ;milander-sharks, twelve feet long, which are particu-  larly dreaded by divers,: sea-foxes, eight feet long, endowed     194 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   with a wonderful sense of smell : magnificent sturgeons  which resembling sharks in size, lashed their tails against  the glass of the vessel ; conger-eels with serpent-like  movements ; swallow-trygles, swimming with the rapidity  of the bird from whom they take their name ; splendid  turbots, those sea-pheasants, a kind of lozenge with yellow  fins specked with brown, and the left side of which is  marked brown and yellow ; and lastly troops of admirable  red-mullet, veritable ocean birds of Paradise. The most  numerous inhabitants of the Mediterranean are, however,  the sombre tunnies with blue-black backs, belly cuirassed  with silver, and whose dorsal fins threw out gleams of gold.  They have the reputation of following ships for the sake  of their shade under tropical skies. For many long hours  they tried to keep up with our apparatus. I was never  tired of admiring these animals, veritably fashioned for  speed, their small heads, their lithe and fusiform bodies  that in some of them were more than three yards long,  their pectoral fins endowed with remarkable vigour, and  their forked caudals. They swam in a triangle, like certain  flocks of birds, whose rapidity they equalled.   During the night between the i6th and I7th of February  we entered the second Mediterranean basin, the greatest  depths of which are found at 1,500 fathoms. The Nautilus,  under the action of its screw, gliding over its inclined planes,  sank into the lowest depths of the sea.   There, instead of natural marvels, the mass of waters  offered me many touching and terrible scenes. In fact,  we were then crossing all that part of the Mediterranean so  fertile in disasters. From the Algerian coast to the shores  of Provence, how many vessels have been wrecked, how  many ships have disappeared ! The Mediterranean is only  a lake compared to the vast liquid plains of the Pacific,  but it is a capricious lake with changing waters, to-day  propitious and caressing to the fragile tartan that seems to  float between the double ultramarine of sea and sky, to-  morrow tempestuous, agitated by winds, breaking up the  strongest ships by the precipitated blows of its short waves.   In that rapid course across the great depths what wrecks  I saw lying on the ground !     UNDER THE SEA 195   Amongst these wrecks some had been caused by collision,  others had struck upon some granite rock. I saw some  that had sunk straight down with upright mast, and rigging  stiffened by the water. They seemed to be at anchor in an  immense roadway, only awaiting the time of starting. When  the Nautilus passed amongst them, and enveloped them  with its electric light, it seemed as if they would salute our  vessel with their colours, and give the orders. But no ;  nothing but the silence of death reigned in the field of  catastrophes ! Ah, what a fatal history would be that of  these Mediterranean depths, this vast charnel-house where  so many riches have been lost, and so many victims have  met with their death !   In the meantime the Nautilus, indifferent and rapid, jour-  neyed at full speed amidst these ruins. On the i8th of  February, about 3 a.m., it was at the entrance to the Straits  of Gibraltar.   There two currents exist an upper current, long since  known, that conveys the waters of the ocean into the  Mediterranean basin, and a lower counter-current, of which  reasoning has now shown the existence. For the volume of  water in the Mediterranean, incessantly increased by the  Atlantic current and the rivers that flow into it, must raise  the level of the sea every year, for its evaporation is insuffi-  cient to restore the equilibrium. As this is not the case,  we must naturally admit the existence of a lower current  that pours through the Straits of Gibraltar, the overplus of  the Mediterranean into the Atlantic.   We proved this fact. The Nautilus profited by this  counter-current. It rushed rapidly through the narrow  passage. For an instant I caught a glimpse of the admir-  able ruins of the temple of Hercules, sunk, according to  Pliny and Avienus, with the low island on which it stood,  and a few minutes later we were afloat on the waves of the  Atlantic.     196 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   CHAPTER VIII   VI GO BAY   THE Atlantic ! that vast extent of water the superficial  area of which covers twenty-five millions of square miles,  nine thousand miles long, with a mean breadth of two thou-  sand seven hundred miles. An ocean into which the largest  rivers of the world flow the waters of the most civilised  as well as those of the most savage countries ! A magni-  ficent plain, incessantly ploughed by ships of all nations,  sheltered under the flags of every nation, and terminated  by the two terrible points, dreaded by navigators, Cape  Horn and the Cape of Tempests.   The Nautilus was culling its waters under her sharp  prow after having accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues  in three months and a half, a distance greater than one of  the great circles of the earth. Where were we going now,  and what had the future in store for us ?   The Nautilus once out of the Straits of Gibraltar came up  to the surface again, and our daily walks on the platform  were thus restored to us.   I immediately went up there, accompanied by Ned Land  and Conseil. At a distance of twelve miles, Cape Vincent,  which forms a point of the Spanish peninsula, was dimly to  be seen. It was blowing a rather strong gale. The sea  was rough. It made the Nautilus rock violently. It was  almost impossible to keep on the platform, which enormous  seas washed at every moment. We therefore went down  again after taking in some mouthfuls of fresh air.   I went back to my room ,and Conseil returned to his cabin j  but the Canadian, with a preoccupied air, followed me.  Our rapid passage across the Mediterranean had prevented  him putting his projects into execution, and he did not  hide his disappointment.   When the door of my cabin was shut, he sat down and  looked at me in silence.    Friend Ned, I said,  I understand you, but you have  nothing to reproach yourself with. To have attempted to     UNDER THE SEA 197   leave the Nautilus while it was going at that rate would have  been madness.   Ned Land answered nothing. His compressed lips and  frowning brow indicated the violent possession this idea  of a dash for liberty had taken of his mind.    Well, said I,  we need not despair yet. We are going  up the coast of Portugal. France and England are not  far off. If the Nautilus, once out of the Straits of Gibraltar,  had gone southward, if it had carried us towards those  regions where land is wanting, I should share your un-  easiness. But now we know that Captain Nemo does not  avoid civilised seas, and in a few days I think we can act  with some security.   Ned Land looked at me with a most determined expres-  sion, and at length he opened his lips.    It is for to-night. said he.   I started. I must acknowledge I was little prepared for  this communication. I wanted to answer the Canadian,  but words would not come.    We agreed to wait for an opportunity, said Ned Land.   I have that opportunity. This night we shall only be a  few miles off the Spanish coast. The night will be dark.  I have your word, M. Aronnax, and I depend upon you.   As I still was silent, the Canadian rose, and coming  nearer to me said    This evening, at 9 o'clock. I have told Conseil. At  that time Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, and  probably in bed. Neither the engineers nor any of the  crew can see us. Conseil and I will go to the central stair-  case. You, M. Aronnax, must remain in the library not  far off, and await our signal. The oars, mast, and sail are  in the boat, and I have even succeeded in putting some  provisions into it. I procured an English wrench to un-  screw the bolts that fasten the boat to the hull of the  Nautilus. Thus everything is ready for to-night.    The sea is bad.    That I allow, answered the Canadian,  but we must  risk that. Liberty is worth paying for. Besides, the  boat is solid, and a few miles with the wind in our favour  are not of any consequence. Who knows if to-morrow we     198 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   shall not be a hundred leagues out ? If circumstances  favour us we shall land, living or dead, on some point of  solid ground between 10 and n o'clock. Then to-night,  by the grace of God !    Thereupon the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost  stunned. No sooner had I regained my composure, than  my reflections upon Ned Land's plans were disturbed by a  loud hissing sound which denoted that the reservoirs were  being filled, whilst the Nautilus was gradually sinking.   I remained in my room. I wished to avoid the captain in  order to hide from his eyes the emotion I was labouring  under. It was a sad day I passed thus between the desire  of being free again and the regret of abandoning the mar-  vellous Nautilus, leaving my submarine studies unfinished !  What wretched hours passed thus, sometimes seeing myself  safely on board with my companions, sometimes wishing,  in spite of my reason, that some unforeseen circumstance  would prevent the realisation of Ned Land's projects !   Twice I went into the saloon. I wished to consult the  compass, and to see if the Nautilus was approaching or  going farther away from the coast. But no. The Nautilus  kept constantly in the Portuguese waters. It was making  for the north along the shores of the ocean.   I was, therefore, obliged to make up my mind to prepare  for flight. My baggage consisted of my notes, nothing  more. I asked myself what Captain Nemo would think of  our flight, what uneasiness it might cause him, what harm it  might do him, and what he would do in case it was dis-  covered or it failed. Certainly I had no fault to find with  him on the contrary. Hospitality was never given more  freely than his. In leaving him I could not be accused of  ingratitude. No oath bound us to him. He counted upon  the force of circumstances alone, and not upon our word,  to keep us with him for ever. But his intention, openly  avowed, of keeping us eternally prisoners on board his  vessel justified our attempts.   It struck me that I had not seen Captain Nemo foi  several days, and I began to wonder whether he was on  board at all. Since the night during which the boat had  left the Nautilus on a mysterious mission, my ideas about     UNDER THE SEA 199   him were slightly modified. I thought, whatever he might  say about it, that he must have kept up some sort of com-  munication with land. Did he never leave the Nautilus ?  Entire weeks had passed without my having seen him.  What was he doing during that time ?   All these ideas, and a thousand more, assailed me at  once. That day of waiting seemed to me eternal. The  hours struck too slowly for my impatience.   My dinner was served as usual in my room. I ate little,  being too much preoccupied. I left the table at seven  o'clock. A hundred and twenty minutes I counted them  still separated me from the time when I was to join Ned  Land. My agitation redoubled. My pulse beat violently.  I could not remain motionless, and I stepped up and down  as though the exercise would relieve my troubled mind.   I wished to see the saloon for the last time. I went by  the waist, and entered that museum where I had passed  so many useful and agreeable hours. I looked at all these  riches and treasures like a man on the eve of eternal exile,  and who is going away never to return. These marvels of  nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for so  many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to  leave them for ever. I should have liked to look through  the windows across the waters of the Atlantic ; but the  panels were shut.   As I moved thus about the saloon I reached the door,  let into the angle, which opened into the captain's room.  To my great astonishment this door was ajar. I drew back  involuntarily. If Captain Nemo was in his room he could  see me. However, hearing no noise, I drew near it. The  room was empty. I pushed open the door and entered.  Still the same severe monk-like aspect.   Suddenly the clock struck eight. The first stroke awoke  me to reality. I trembled as if some invisible eye could see  to the bottom of my thoughts, and I rushed out of the room.   There I glanced at the compass. Our course was still  north. The log indicated moderate speed, the manometer  a depth of about sixty feet. Circumstances, therefore,  were favouring the Canadian's project.   I went back to my room and clothed myself warmly in     200 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   my sea-boots, sealskin cap, and vest of byssus lined with  sealskin. I was ready. I waited. The vibration of the  screw alone disturbed the profound silence that reigned on  board. I listened attentively. Would not a shout tell  me all at once that Ned Land had been caught in his effort  to escape ? A mortal dread took possession of me.   At a few minutes to nine o'clock I put my ear against the  captain's door. No sound. I left my room and went back  to the saloon, which was insufficiently lighted, but empty.   I opened the door communicating with the library.  The same insufficient light, the same solitude. I went and  placed myself near the door that opened into the cage of  the central staircase, and awaited Ned Land's signal.   At the moment the vibration from the screw sensibly dimi-  nished, then ceased altogether. Why was this change made  in the working of the Nautilus ? Whether this halt would  be favourable to or against Ned Land's plans I could not  tell.   The silence was only broken by the beatings of my heart.   Suddenly I felt a slight shock. I understood that the  Nautilus had just stopped on the bottom of the ocean. My  anxiety increased. The Canadian's signal did not reach me.  I wanted to go to Ned Land and beg him to put off his  attempt. I felt that something was changed in our usual  navigation.   At that moment the saloon door opened, and Captain  Nemo appeared. He perceived me, and said without  further preamble, in an amiable tone    Ah, professor, I was looking for you. Do you know  your Spanish history ?    Any one knowing the history of his own country thor-  oughly under the same conditions of mental worry and  anxiety, would not be able to quote a single word of it.    Well, continued Captain Nemo,  you heard my  question. Do you know the history of Spain ?     Very badly, I replied.    That is like savants, said the captain.   He stretched himself upon a divan and I mechanically  took a place beside him with my back to the light. He  proceeded to describe the war of 1702 which deter-     UNDER THE SEA 201   mined the successor to Charles II on the Spanish throne,  and wound up by reminding me of an episode in which a  score of galleons, loaded with bullion from America, were  sunk in Vigo Bay.    Well, M. Aronnax, proceeded Captain Nemo,  we  are in Vigo Bay and it rests with yourself whether you will  penetrate into its mysteries.   The captain rose and begged me to follow him. I had  had time to recover myself. I obeyed. The saloon was  dark, but across the transparent panes glittered the sea.  I looked.   For a radius of half-a-mile round the Nautilus the waters  seemed impregnated with electric light, the sandy bottom  clear and distinct. Some of the crew, clothed in their  bathing dresses, were at work emptying half-rotten casks,  splintered cases, amidst still blackened spars. From these  cases and casks escaped ingots of gold and silver. The sand  was strewed with them. Then, loaded with their previous  booty, these men returned to the Nautilus, deposited their  load, and went back to continue their inexhaustible gold and  silver fishery.   I understood. Here Captain Nemo came, according to  his needs, to encase the millions with which he ballasted  his Nautilus.    Did you know, professor, he asked me, smiling,  that  the sea contained such riches ?     I knew, I answered,  that the silver sank in the sea  is estimated at two millions of tons.    Doubtless, but in order to extract the silver the ex-  pense would be greater than the profit. Here, on the con-  trary, I have only to pick up what men have lost, not only  in this Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other scenes of ship-  wreck, all marked on my marine chart. Now do you under-  stand why I am so many times a millionaire ?     Yes, captain. But allow me to tell you that in your  work in Vigo Bay you have only been beforehand with a  rival company.    What company, pray ?     A company that has received from the Spanish govern-  ment the privilege of seeking the shipwrecked galleons.     202 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   The shareholders are tempted by the bait of an enormous  profit, for they estimate the value of these shipwrecked  treasures at five hundred millions of francs.    Five hundred millions !  answered Captain Nemo ;   they were that much once, but are so no longer.    Just so, said I,  and a warning to the shareholders  would be an act of charity. Who knows, however, if it  would be well received ? What speculators regret, above  all, generally, is less the loss of money than that of their  insane hopes. I pity them, after all, less than the thousands  of unfortunates to whom so much wealth, well distributed,  would have been profitable, whilst it is for ever lost to them.   I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt it must  have wounded Captain Nemo.    Lost to them !  he answered, getting animated.  Do  you think, then, that this wealth is lost when it is I that  gather it ? Do you think I give myself the trouble to pick  up these treasures for myself ? Who says that I do not  make a good use of them ? Do you believe that I ignore  the existence of suffering beings, of races oppressed in this  world, of miserable creatures to solace, of victims to re-  venge ? Do you not understand    Captain Nemo stopped, regretting, perhaps, having said  so much. But I had guessed. Whatever might be the  motives that had forced him to seek independence under  the seas, he was still a man ! His heart still beat for the  sufferings of humanity, and his immense charity was given  to oppressed races, as well as to individuals.   And I then understood to whom the millions were sent  by Captain Nemo, while the Nautilus was cruising in the  waters of revolted Crete.   CHAPTER IX   A VANISHED CONTINENT   ON the morning of the next day, the igth of February,  I saw the Canadian enter my room. I was expecting his  visit. He looked much disappointed.    Well, sir, he said to me.    Well, Ned, luck was against us yesterday.     UNDER THE SEA 203    Yes, that captain must stop at the very time we were  going to escape from his vessel.    Yes, Ned, he had business with his banker.    His banker ?     Yes, or rather his bank. I mean by that this ocean,  where his wealth is in greater safety than it would be in the  coffers of a state.   I then related to the Canadian the incident of the pre-  ceding evening, in the secret hope of making him wish not  to leave the captain ; but the only result of my account was  an energetic regret expressed by Ned at not being able to  take a walk on the Vigo treasure store on his own account.    But all is not over, he said.  It is only one harpoon-  throw lost. Another time we shall succeed, and this very  evening, if necessary     What is the direction of the Nautilus ?  I asked.    I do not know, answered Ned.    Well, at noon we shall find our bearings.   The Canadian feturned to Conseil. As soon as I was  dressed I went into the saloon. The compass was not  reassuring. We were turning our backs on Europe.   I waited impatiently for our bearings to be taken. About  11.30 a.m. the reservoirs were emptied, and our apparatus  went up to the surface of the ocean. I sprang upon the  platform. Ned Land preceded me there.   There was no land in sight. Nothing but the immense  sea. A few sails on the horizon, doubtless those that go as  far as San-Roque in search of favourable winds for doubling  the Cape of Good Hope. The weather was cloudy. A  gale was springing up.   Ned, in a rage, tried to pierce the misty horizon. He still  hoped that behind the mist stretched the land so much  desired.   At noon the sun appeared for an instant. The first  officer took advantage of the gleam to take the altitude.  Then, the sea becoming rougher, we went down again, and  the panel was closed.   An hour afterwards, when I consulted the map, I saw  that the Nautilus was 150 leagues from the nearest coast.  It was no use to attempt escaping now, and I leave Ned     204 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Land's anger to be imagined when I informed him of our  situation.   On my account I was not overwhelmed with grief. 1  felt relieved from a weight that was oppressing me, and I  could calmly take up my habitual work again.   That evening, about n p.m., I received an unexpected  visit from Captain Nemo. He asked me very graciously if  I felt fatigued from sitting up so late the night before. I  answered in the negative.    Then, M. Aronnax, I have a curious excursion to pro-  pose to you.    What is it, captain ?     You have as yet only been on the sea-bottom by day-  light. Should you like to see it on a dark night ?     I should like it much.    It will be a fatiguing walk, I warn you. You will  have to go far, and climb a mountain. The roads are not  very well kept in repair.    What you tell me makes me doubly curious. I am  ready to follow you.    Come, then, professor. We will go and put on our  diving dresses.   When we reached the ward-room I saw that neither  my companions nor any of the crew were to follow us in  our excursion. Captain Nemo had not even asked me to  take Ned or Conseil.   In a few minutes we had put on our apparatus. They  placed on our backs the reservoirs full of air, but the elec-  tric lamps were not prepared. I mentioned this latter  fact to the captain.    They would be of no use to us, he answered.   I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat  my observation, for the captain's head had already dis-  appeared under its metallic covering. I finished harnessing  myself, felt that some one placed an iron spiked stick in my  hand, and a few minutes later, after the usual manoeuvre  we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic, at a depth of  150 fathoms.   Midnight was approaching. The waters were in pro-  found darkness, but Captain Nemo showed me a reddish     UNDER THE SEA 205   point in the distance, a sort of large light shining about  two miles from the Nautilus. What this fire was, with  what fed, why and how it burnt in the liquid mass, I could  not tell. Any way it lighted us, dimly it is true, but I soon  became accustomed to the peculiar darkness, and I under-  stood, under the circumstances, the uselessness of the  electric light apparatus.   Captain Nemo and I walked side by side directly to-  wards the light. The smooth-surfaced soil ascended  gradually. We took long strides, helping ourselves with  our sticks, but our progress was slow, for our feet often  sank in a sort of mud covered with seaweed and flat stones.   As we went along I heard a sort of pattering above my  head. The noise sometimes redoubled, and produced some-  thing like a continuous shower. I soon understood the  cause. It was rain falling violently and splashing the  surface of the waves. Instinctively I was seized with the  idea that I should be wet through. By water, in water !  I could not help laughing at the odd idea. But the truth  is that under a thick diving dress the liquid element is no  longer felt, and it only seems like an atmosphere rather  denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, that is all.   After half-an-hour's walking we were stepping along rocks  covered with microscopic creatures which lighted us with  their phosphorescent gleams. My foot often slipped upon  the treacherous carpet of seaweed, and without my stock  I should have fallen several times. Turning, I still saw the  white light of the Nautilus gleaming in the distance.   Still plodding along it seemed to me that my heavy  leaden shoes were crushing a litter of bones that cracked  with a dry noise. What, then, was this vast plain I was  thus moving across ? I should have liked to question the  captain, but his language by signs, that allowed him to talk  to his companions when they followed him in his submarine  excursions, was still incomprehensible to me.   In the meantime the reddish light that guided us in-  creased and inflamed the horizon. The presence of this fire  under the seas excited my curiosity to the highest pitch.   Our road grew lighter and lighter. The white light  shone from the top of a mountain about eight hundred feet     206 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   high. But what I perceived was only a reflection made by  the crystal of the water. The fire, the source of the inex-  plicable light, was on the opposite side of the mountain.   Amidst the stony paths that furrowed the bottom of the  Atlantic Captain Nemo went on without hesitating. He  knew the dark route, had doubtless often been along it, and  could not lose himself in it. I followed him with unshaken  confidence and admired his tall stature like a black shadow  on the luminous background of the horizon.   It was one o'clock in the morning. We had reached the  first slopes of the mountain. But the way up led through  the difficult paths of a vast thicket.   Yes, a thicket of dead trees, leafless, sapless, mineralised  under the action of the water, overtopped here and there by  gigantic pines. It was like a coal-series, still standing, hold-  ing by its roots to the soil that had given way, and whose  branches, like fine black paper-cuttings, stood out against  the water' ceiling. The paths were encumbered with sea-  weed and fucus, amongst which swarmed a world of crus-  taceans. I went on climbing over the rocks, leaping over  the fallen trunks, breaking the sea-creepers that balanced  from one tree to another, startling the fish that flew from  branch to branch. Pressed onwards, I no longer felt any  fatigue. I followed my guide, who was never fatigued.   What a spectacle ! How can I depict it ? How de-  scribe the aspect of the woods and rocks in this liquid ele-  ment, their lower parts sombre and wild, the upper coloured  with red tints in the light which the reverberating power ol  the water doubled ? We were climbing rocks which fell in  enormous fragments directly afterwards with the noise ol  an avalanche. Right and left were deep dark galleries  where sight was lost. Here opened vast clearings that  seemed made by the hand of man, and I asked myself some-  times if some inhabitant of these submarine regions was  not about to appear suddenly.   But Captain Nemo still went on climbing. I would not  be left behind. My stick lent me useful aid. A false step  would have been dangerous in these narrow paths, hol-  lowed out of the sides of precipices ; but I walked along  with a firm step without suffering from giddiness. Some-     UNDER THE SEA 207   times I jumped over a crevice the depth of which would  have made me recoil on the glaciers of the earth ; some-  times I ventured on the vacillating trunks of trees thrown  from one abyss to another without looking under my feet,  having only eyes to admire the savage sites of that region.  There, monumental rocks perched on these irregularly-  cut bases seemed to defy the laws of equilibrium. Between  their stony knees grew trees like a jet of water under strong  pressure, sustaining and sustained by the rocks. Then,  natural towers, large scarps cut perpendicularly like a  fortress curtain, inclining at an angle which the laws of  gravitation would not have authorised on the surface of the  terrestrial regions.   And did I not myself feel the difference due to the powerful  density of the water, when, notwithstanding my heavy gar-  ments, my brass headpiece, my metal soles, I climbed slopes  impracticably steep, clearing them, so to speak with the  agility of a chamois ?   I feel that this recital of an excursion under the sea  cannot sound probable. I am the historian of things that  seem impossible, and that yet are real and incontestable. I  did not dream. I saw and felt.   Two hours after having quitted the Nautilus we had passed  the trees, and a hundred feet above our heads rose the sum-  mit of the mountain, the projection of which made a sha-  dow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope. A  few petrified bushes were scattered hither and thither in  grimacing zigzags. The fish rose in shoals before us like  birds surprised in the tall grass. The rocky mass was  hollowed out into impenetrable confractuosities, deep  grottoes, bottomless holes, in which I heard formidable  noises. My blood froze in my veins when I perceived  some enormous tentacular creature barricading my path,  or some frightful claw shutting up with noise in the dark  cavities. Thousands of luminous points shone amidst the  darkness. They were the eyes of giant lobsters wtiich were  moving their claws with the clanking sound of metal ;  titanic crabs pointed like cannon on their carriages, and  frightful poulps, intertwining their tentacles like a living  nest of serpents.     208 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   But I could not stop. Captain Nemo, familiar with these  terrible animals, paid no attention to them. We had  arrived at the first plateau, where other surprises awaited  me. There rose picturesque rums which betrayed the  hand of man, and not that of the Creator. They were vast  heaps of stones in the vague outlines of castles and temples,  clothed with zoophytes in flower, and seaweed.   But what, then, was this portion of the globe swallowed  up by the ocean ? Where was I ? where had Captain Nemo's  whim brought me to ?   I should have liked to question him. As I could not do  that, I stopped him. I seized his arm. But he, shaking  his head, and pointing to the last summit, seemed to say  to me    Higher ! Still higher !    I followed him with a last effort, and in a few minutes I  had climbed the peak that overtopped for about thirty  feet all the rocky mass.   I looked at the side we had just climbed. The mountain  only rose seven or eight hundred feet above the plain |  but on the opposite side it commanded from twice that  height the depths of this portion of the Atlantic. My eyes  wandered over a large space lighted up by a violent ful-  guration. In fact, this mountain was a volcano. At fifty  feet below the peak, amidst a rain of stones and lava, a  wide crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell  in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass. Thus  placed, the volcano, like an immense torch, lighted up the  lower plain to the last limits of the horizon.   I have said that the submarine crater thew out lava, but  not flames. The oxygen of the air is necessary to make a  flame, and it cannot exist in water ; but the streams of red-  hot lava struggled victoriously against the liquid element,  and turned it to vapour by its contact. Rapid currents  carried away all this gas in diffusion, and the lava torrent  glided to the foot of the mountain.   There, before my eyes, ruined, destroyed, overturned,  appeared a town, its roofs crushed in, its temples thrown  down, its arches disjointed, its columns lying on the ground,  with the solid proportions of Tuscan architecture still dis-     UNDER THE SEA 209   cernible upon them ; further on were the remains of a  gigantic aqueduct ; here, the incrusted base of an Acro-  polis, and the outlines of a Parthenon ; there, some vestiges  of a quay, as if some ancient port had formerly sheltered,  on the shores of an extinct ocean, merchant vessels and  war galleys ; further on still, long lines of ruined walls,  wide deserted streets, a second Pompeii buried under the  waters, raised up again for me by Captain Nemo.   Where was I ? Where was I ? I wished to know at any  price. I felt I must speak, and tried to take off the globe  of brass that imprisoned my head.   But Captain Nemo came to me and stopped me with a  gesture. Then picking up a piece of chalky stone he went  up to a black basaltic rock and traced on it the single word    ATLANTIS.   What a flash of lightning shot through my mind !  Atlantis, the ancient Meropis of Theopompus, the Atlantis  of Plato, the continent disbelieved in by many historians,  who placed its disappearance amongst legendary tales ;  Atlantis was there before my eyes bearing upon it the un-  exceptionable testimony of its catastrophe ! This, then,  was the engulphed region that existed beyond Europe, Asia  a.nd Lybia, beyond the columns of Hercules, where the  powerful Atlantides lived, against whom the first wars of  Ancient Greece were waged.   Thus, then, led by the strangest fate, I was treading on  one of the mountains of this continent ! I was touching  with my hand these ruins a thousand times secular and con-  temporaneous with the geological epochs. I was walking  where the contemporaries of the first man had walked.  I was crushing under my heavy soles the skeletons of  animals of those far-off days.   Ah ! why did time fail me ? I should have liked to  descend the steep sides of this mountain, and go over the  whole of the immense continent that doubtless joined  Africa to America, and to visit the great antediluvian  cities. One day, perhaps, some eruptive phenomenon  would bring these engulphed regions back to the surface of  the waves. Sounds that announced a profound struggle of     210 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   the elements have been heard, and volcanic cinders pro-  jected out of the water have been found. All this ground, as  far as the Equator, is till worked by underground forces.  And who knows if in some distant epoch the summits of  volcanic mountains will not appear on the surface of the  Atlantic ?   Whilst I was thus dreaming, trying to fix every detail of  the grand scene in my memory, Captain Nemo, leaning  agiinst a moss-covered fragment of ruin, remained motion-  less as if in an ecstasy. Was he dreamirg about the long-  gne generations and asking them the secret of human  destiny ? Was it there that this strange man came to  refresh his historical memories and live again that ancient  existence ? he who would have no modern one. What  would I not have given to know his thoughts, to share and  understand them !   We remained in the same place for a whole hour, con-  templating the vast plain in the light of the lava that  sometimes was surprisingly intense. The interior bub-  blings made rapid tremblings pass over the outside of the  mountain. Deep noises, clearly transmitted by the liquid  medium, were echoed with majestic amplitude.   At that moment the moon appeared for an instant  through the mass of waters and threw her pale rays over  the engulphed continent. It was only a gleam, but its  effect was indescribable. The captain rose,' gave a last  look at the immense plain, and then, with his hand, signed  me to follow him.   We rapidly descended the mountain. When we had once  passed the mineral forest I perceived the lantern of the  Nautilus shining like a star. The captain walked straight  towards it, and we were back on board as the first tints of  dawn whitened the surface of the ocean.     CHAPTER X   SUBMARINE COALFIELDS   THE next day, the 2oth of February, I awoke very late.  The fatigues of the previous night had prolonged my sleep     UNDER THE SEA 211   until eleven o'clock. I dressed promptly. 1 was in a hurry  to know the direction of the Nautilus. The instrument  informed me that it was running southward at a speed of  twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.   Conseil entered. I gave him an account of our nocturnal  excursion, and the panels being opened, he could still get a  glimpse of the submerged continent.   In fact, the Nautilus was moving only five fathoms from  the soil of the Atlantis plain. It was flying like a balloon  before the wind above terrestrial prairies ; but it would be  more according to fact to say that we were in this saloon  like being in a carriage of an express train. In the fore-  ground were fantastically-shaped rocks, forests of trees  transformed from the vegetable to the mineral kingdom  whose immovableoutlines appeared under the waves.   Whilst passing these sights I related the history of the  Atlantides to Conseil. I told him all about the wars of  this extinct nation. I discussed the question of the Atlan-  tis as a man who has no doubts left on the subject. But  Conseil did not pay much attention to my historical lesson,  and I soon saw why.   Numerous fishes were attracting his attention, and when  fish were passing, Conseil was always lost in an abyss of  classification and left the real world. In that case all I  had to do was to follow him and go on with our studies.   But these Atlantic fish did not much differ from those we  had observed elsewhere. They were principally rays of  gigantic size, five yards long, and endowed with great mus-  cular strength, which allows them to spring up out of the  waves ; sharks of many kinds amongst others a glaucus,  fifteen feet long, with sharp triangular teeth, whose trans-  parency rendered it almost invisible in the water ; stur-  geons, similar to the Mediterranean tribe ; horn fish, a foot  and a half long, of yellow-brown colour, with little grey fins,  without teeth or tongue, as fine and supple as serpents ; and  lastly, swordfish, eight yards long, swimming in shoals,  bearing yellowish scythe-shaped fins and blades six feet  long intrepid animals more herbivorous than piscivorous,  who obey the least sign from their females, like henpecked  husbands.     212 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Sometimes the capricious undulations of the ground  forced the Nautilus to slacken speed whilst it glided, with  all the skill of a whale, amongst the narrow passes between  the hills. If the labyrinth proved inextricable the appara-  tus rose like a balloon, and, once the obstacle cleared, it  went on its rapid way some yards above the bottom  admirable and charming navigation that recalled the man-  oeuvres of a balloon journey, with this difference, however,  that the Nautilus passively obeyed the hand of its helms-  man.   About 4 p.m. the ground, generally composed of thick  mud and mineralised branches, gradually changed ; it be-  came more rocky and appeared strewn with an accumula-  tion of pieces of lava and sulphurous glass. I thought that  a mountainous region would soon succeed the long plains,  and in fact, during certain evolutions of the Nautilus, I  perceived the southern horizon bounded by a high wall  that seemed to close all issue. Its summit evidently passed  above the level of the ocean. It must be a continent, or at  least an island. Our bearings not having been taken per-  haps purposely I was ignorant of our whereabouts. In  any case such a wall appeared to me to mark the end of that  Atlantis of which, after all, we had seen so little.   The night did not put a stop to my observations. Con-  seil had gone to his cabin. The Nautilus, vAih varying speed,  glided over the confused masses on the ground, sometimes  almost touching them as to rest on them, sometimes going  up whimsically to the surface of the waves.   I should have remained much longer at my window, ad-  miring the beauties of sea and sky, but the panels were  shut. At that moment the Nautilus was close to the high  wall. What it would do now I could not guess. I went to  my room. The Nautilus did not move. I went to sleep  with the firm intention of waking after a few hours' slumber.   But the next day it was eight o'clock when I returned to  the saloon. I looked at the manometer. It showed me  that the Nautilus was floating on the surface of the ocean.  I heard, besides, a noise of footsteps on the platform.  However, no rolling betrayed to me the undulation of the  upper waves.     UNDER THE SEA 213   I went up as far as the panel. It was open. But instead  of the broad daylight I expected, I was surrounded by pro-  found darkness. Where were we ? Had I made a mistake ?  Was it still night ? No there was not a star shining, and  no night is so absolutely dark.   I did not know what to think when a voice said to me    Is that you, professor ?     Ah, Captain Nemo, I answered ;  where are we ?    Under the ground, professor.    Under ground !  I cried,  and the Nautilus still float-  ing ?     Yes ; it floats still.    But I do not understand.    Wait a few minutes. Our lantern is going to be lighted  and if you want a light on the subject you will soon be  satisfied.   I set foot on the platform and waited. The darkness was  so complete that I did not even see Captain Nemo. How-  ever, in looking at the zenith exactly above my head, I  thought I could perceive a vague light a sort of twilight  that filled a circular hole. At that moment the lantern was  suddenly lighted, and its brilliancy made the vague light  vanish.   I looked after having closed my eyes for an instant, daz-  zled by the electric flame. The Nautilus was stationary,  near a bank something like a quay. The sea on which it was  riding was a lake imprisoned in a circle of walls which  measured two miles in diameter, or six miles round. Its  level the manometer indicated it could only be the same  as the exterior level, for a communication naturally existed  between this lake and the sea. The high walls, inclined at  the base, were rounded like a vault, and made a vast tunnel  upside down, the height of which was about 1,200 feet. At  the summit was a circular orifice through which I had seen  the vague light evidently made by daylight.   Before examining the interior dispositions of this enor-  mous cavern more attentively, before asking myself if it  was the work of man or Nature, I went up to Captain Nemo.    Where are we ?  I said.    In the very heart of an extinct volcano, he answered,     214 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    a volcano the interior of which has been invaded by the  sea after some convulsion of the ground. Whilst you were  asleep, professor, the Nautilus penetrated into this lagoon  by a natural channel opened at a depth of five fathoms be-  low the surface of the ocean. This is its port, a sure, con-  venient, and mysterious port, sheltered from all the winds  of heaven. Find me on the coasts of your continents or  islands a roadstead that equals this assured refuge against  the fury of tempests.    You certainly are in safety here, Captain Nemo. Who  could get at you in the heart of a volcano ? But did I not  perceive an aperture at its summit ?     Yes, a crater, a crater formerly filled with lava, smoke,  and flames, which now gives entrance to the life-giving air  we are breathing.    But what volcanic mountain is this, then ?     It belongs to one of the numerous islets with which this  5ea is strewn. A simple rock for ships, for us an immense  cavern. I discovered it by accident, and accident has done  me a good service.    But could not some one descend by the orifice that  forms the crater of the volcano ?     Not more than I could go up through it. For about a  hundred feet the base of the mountain is practicable, but  above the sides overhang and could not be climbed.    I see, captain, that Nature serves you everywhere and  always. You are in safety on this lake, and no one but you  can visit its waters. But what do you want with such a  refuge ? The Nautilus needs no port ?     No, professor, but it needs electricity, the elements to  produce electricity, sodium to feed these elements, coal to  make its sodium, and coal fields to extract the coal. Now  here it happens that the sea covers entire forests that were  buried in geological epochs ; now mineralised and formed  into coal they are an inexhaustible mine to me.    Then your men here, captain, do miners' work ?     Precisely. These mines extend under the water like  the coalfields of Newcastle. It is here that, clad in their  bathing dresses, pickaxe and spade in hand, my men go to  extract the coal that I do not even ask for from the mines of     UNDER THE SEA 215   earth. When I burn this fuel for the fabrication of sodium,  the smoke that escapes through the crater gives it once  more the appearance of an active volcano.    Shall we see your companions at work ?     Not this time, at least, for I am in a hurry to continue  our voyage round the submarine world. So I shall content  myself with taking some of the reserves of sodium that  I possess. One day will suffice to embark them, and then  we shall continue our voyage. If, therefore, you wish to  inspect this cavern and make the tour of the lake, take  advantage of to-day, M. Aronnax.   I thanked the captain and went to look for my two com-  panions, who had not yet left their cabin. I invited them  to follow me without telling them where they were.   They came up on to the platform. Conseil, whom no-  thing astonished, thought it quite natural to wake up under  a mountain after going to sleep under the sea. But Ned  Land's only idea was to try and find out whether the cave  had any other issue.   After breakfast, about 10 a.m., we descended on the bank.    Here we are once more on land, said Conseil.    I don't call this land, answered the Canadian.  And.  besides, we are not upon but underneath.   Between the foot of the mountain slopes and the waters  of the lake ran a sandy shore, which in its widest part  measured five hundred feet. Upon this it was easy to make  the tour of the lake. But the base of the slopes formed an  irregular soil, on which lay, in picturesque heaps, volcanic  blocks and enormous pieces of pumice-stone. All these dis-  integrated masses, covered under the action of subterranean  fires with polished enamel, shone in the lantern's electric  flames. The glittering mineral dust of the shore that rose  under our footsteps flew up like a cloud of sparks.   The ground gradually rose from the water, and we soon  reached long and sinuous slopes, veritable ascents that  allowed us to climb by degrees, but we were obliged to walk  prudently amongst the accumulation that no cement joined  together, and afforded no firm foothold.   The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was  visible on all sides. I pointed it out to my companions.     216 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Can you picture to yourselves, I asked them,  what  this enormous tunnel must have been like when filled with  boiling lava, and the level of the incandescent liquid rose  to the orifice of the mountain like molten metal on the sides  of a furnace ?     I can picture it to myself perfectly, answered Conseil.   But will monsieur tell me why the Great Smelter sus-  pended His operation, and how it is that the furnace is  replaced by the tranquil waters of a lake ?     It is very likely, Conseil, that some convulsion made  that opening under the surface of the ocean which gave in-  gress to the Nautilus. Then the waters of the Atlantic  rushed into the interior of the mountain. There was a ter-  rible struggle between the two elements, a struggle that  terminated to the advantage of Neptune. But many cen-  turies have elapsed since then, and the submerged volcano  is changed into a peaceful grotto.    Very well, replied Ned Land.  I accept the explana-  tion, but I regret in our interest that the opening of which  you speak did not take place above the sea-level.    But, friend Ned, replied Conseil,  if this passage had  not been submarine the Nautilus could not have gone  through it.    And I may add, Ned, said I,  that the waters would  not have rushed under the volcano, and that the volcano  would have remained a volcano. Therefore your regrets  are wasted.   Our ascension continued. The slopes became steeper and  narrower. Sometimes profound excavations lay in the way  which we were obliged to cross. Overhanging masses had  to be avoided. We crawled on our hands and knees. But  by the help of Conseil's skill, and the Canadian's strength,  we overcame all obstacles.   At a height of about ten feet the nature of the ground  changed. It was a rock of a black basaltic nature spread  in layers full of bubbles ; some forming regular prisms,  placed like a colonnade supporting the spring of an immense  vault, an admirable specimen of natural architecture.  Then, amongst these basalts lay serpent-like streams of  cooled lava, encrusted with bituminous stripes, and, in     UNDER THE SEA 217   some places, lay wide carpets of sulphur. A more powerful  light, shining through the upper crater, shed a vague glim-  mer over all these volcanic dejections buried for ever in the  heart of the extinct mountain.   However, our ascent was soon stopped at a height of  about 250 feet by impassable obstacles. There was quite  a vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was ex-  changed for a circular walk. Here the vegetable kingdom  began to struggle with the mineral kingdom.   We had arrived at the foot of a thicket of robust dragon-  trees which had pushed aside the rocks by the effort of their  muscular roots, when Ned Land exclaimed    Why, here's a swarm of bees, sir !     A swarm ?  replied I, with a gesture of perfect incre-  dulity.    Yes, a swarm, repeated the Canadian j  and the bees  are buzzing all about it.   I approached and was forced to surrender to evidence.  There, at the entrance to a hole in the trunk of a dragon-  tree, were several thousands of the industrious insects so  common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so par-  ticularly esteemed.   The Canadian naturally wished to make a provision of  honey, and it would have been churlish to me of refuse it.  He lighted a quantity of dry leaves, mixed with sulphur,  by means of a spark from his flint, and began to smoke out  the bees. The buzzing gradually ceased, and the hive  eventually yielded several pounds of perfumed honey, with  which Ned Land filled his haversack.   At certain turns of the path we were following, the lake  appeared in its whole extent. The lantern lighted up the  whole of its peaceful surface that knew neither ripple nor  wave. The Nautilus kept perfectly still. On the platform  and the shore the ship's crew were working like black  shadows clearly cut against the luminous atmosphere.   At that moment we were rounding the highest crest of the  first layers of rock that upheld the roof. I then saw that  bees were not the only representatives of the animal king-  dom in the interior of this vojcano. Birds of prey hovered  and turned here and there in the darkness, or fled from their     218 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   nests perched on the points of rock. There were sparrow-  hawks with white breasts and screaming kestrels. Down  the slopes also scampered, with all the rapidity of their long  stilts, fine fat bustards. I leave it to be imagined if the  covetousness of the Canadian was roused at the sight of this  savoury game, and if he did not regret not having a gun in  his hands. He tried to substitute stones for lead, and after  several fruitless attempts he succeeded in wounding a mag-  nificent bird. To say that he risked his life twenty times  before hitting it is but the truth ; but he managed so well  that the animal was deposited with the honeycombs in his  bag.   We were now obliged to descend towards the shore, the  crest becoming impracticable. Above us the gaping crater  looked like the wide mouth of a well. From this place the  sky could be clearly seen, and I saw the dishevelled clouds  running before the west wind touching the summit of the  mountain with their misty fringes a certain proof that  these clouds were low ones, for the volcano did not rise more  than 800 feet above the sea level.   Half-an-hour after the Canadian's exploit we had reached  the inner shore. Here the flora was represented by large  stretches of marine crystal, a little plant, a very good  preserve, popularly known as  pierce-stone,  pass-stone,  and  sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it.  Here there were also thousands of lobsters, crabs, spider-  crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,  rock-fish, and limpets.   At that place opened a magnificent grotto. My com-  panions and I were delighted to lie down on its fine sand.  The fire had polished its enamelled and sparkling sides all  dusted over with mica. Ned Land tapped the walls to try  and find out their thickness. I could not help smiling.  The conversation then turned upon the eternal projects  of flight ; and I thought I would, without saying too much,  give him the hope that Captain Nemo had only come down  south to renew his provision of sodium. I therefore hoped  that now he would go near the coasts of Europe and America,  which would allow the Canadian to renew with more success  his former abortive attempt.     UNDER THE SEA 219   We had been lying for an hour in this charming grotto,  and with the conversation becoming less animated I fell  fast asleep. I was dreaming that my existence was reduced  to the vegetating life of a simple mollusc. It seemed to me  that this grotto formed the double valve of my shell. All  at once I was awakened by Conseil's voice.    Look out ! look out !  cried the worthy fellow.    What is it ?  I asked, raising my head.    The water is coming up to us !    I rose. The water was rushing like a torrent into our  retreat, and as we certainly were not molluscs, we were  obliged to fly.   In a few minutes' time we were in safety on the summit of  the grotto itself.    What was it ?  asked Conseil.  Some new pheno-  menon ?     No, my friends, replied I j it was the tide that al-  most caught us. The ocean outside rises, and, by a natural  law of equilibrium, the level of the lake rises likewise. We  have escaped with a bath. Let us go to the Nautilus and  change our clothes.   Three-quarters of an hour later we had ended our circular  walk, and were back on board. The men of the crew were  then finishing taking the sodium on board, and the Nautilus  could have started at once.   But Captain Nemo gave no order. Perhaps he meant to  wait for night, and go out secretly by his submarine passage.   However that may be, the next day the Nautilus, having  left its moorings, was navigating far from all land, and a few  yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.     CHAPTER XI   THE SARGASSO SEA.   THE direction of the Nautilus had not been changed. All  hope of returning to the European seas must for the present  be given up. Captain Nemo kept to the south.  That day the Nautilus crossed a singular part of the At-     220 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   lantic Ocean. Every one knows of the existence of that  great current of warm water known under the name of the  Gulf Stream. After leaving the Gulf of Florida it goes  towards Spitzbergen j but some time after quitting the Gulf  of Mexico, about the 44th degree of north latitude, this cur-  rent divides into two arms, the principal one going towards  the coasts of Ireland and Norway, whilst the second bends  southward abreast of the Azores j then striking against the  African shores and describing a long oval, it comes back  towards the Antilles.   Now this second arm (it is rather a collar than an arm)  surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of the  cool, quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea. A  perfect lake in full Atlantic, the waters of the great cur-  rent take no less than three years to go round it.   The Sargasso Sea, properly speaking, covers all the sub-  merged part of Atlantis. Certain authors have even stated  that the numerous herbs with which it is strewn are torn  from the prairies of that ancient continent. It is more  probable, however, that these herbs, carried away from the  shores of Europe and America, are brought to this zone by  the Gulf Stream. That was one of the reasons that brought  Columbus to suppose the existence of a new world. When  the ships of this bold navigator arrived at the Sargasso  Sea they sailed with difficulty amidst the herbs that im-  peded their course to the great terror of their crews, and  they lost three long weeks crossing it.   Such was the region the Nautilus was now visiting, a  veritable prairie, a thick carpet of sea-wrack, fucus, and  tropical berries, so thick and compact that the stem of a  vessel could hardly tear its way through it. And Captain  Nemo, not wishing to entangle his screw in that herby mass,  kept at a depth of some yards beneath the surface of the  waves.   Above us floated products of all kinds, entangled amidst  these brownish herbs j trunks of trees, from the Andes or  the Rocky Mountains, floated down the Amazon or the  Mississippi j numerous spars, the remains of keels or ships'  bottoms, side planks stove in, and so weighted with shell  and barnacles that they could not rise to the surface of the     UNDER THE SEA 221   ocean. And time will one day justify a theory that these  substances thus accumulated for ages will become miner-  alised under the action of the water, and will then form in-  exhaustible coal-fields a precious reserve prepared by far-  seeing Nature for the time when men have exhausted the  mines of the continents.   We passed twenty-four hours in the Sargasso Sea, and  the next day the ocean had resumed its accustomed aspect.   For nineteen days , from the 23rd of February to the i2th  of March, the Nautilus, keeping in the midst of the Atlantic  carried us along at a constant speed of one hundred leagues  in twenty-four hours. Captain Nemo evidently intended  to accomplish his submarine programme, and I had no doubt  that after doubling Cape Horn he meant to go back into the  South Pacific.   Ned Land had therefore cause to fear. In these wide  seas, destitute of islands, leaving the vessel could not be  attempted. Neither were there any means of opposing  Captain Nemo's will. The only thing to do was to submit j  but that which could no longer be expected from force or  ruse I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion. This  voyage ended, would not Captain Nemo consent to give us  liberty if we swore never to reveal his existence ? But  would this request for liberty be well received ? Had he  not himself declared at the very beginning, in the most  formal manner, that the secret of his life required our per-  petual imprisonment on board the Nautilus ? Would not  my silence of the last four months appear to him a tacit  acceptation of the situation ? Would not a return to this  subject give rise to suspicions that might be prejudicial to  our projects if some favourable circumstance should cause  us to renew them ? I turned over all these reasons, weighed  them in my mind, and submitted them to Conseil, who was  no less embarrassed than I. On the whole, although I am  not easily discouraged, I understood that the chances of  ever seeing my fellows again were diminishing from day to  day ; above all, now that Captain Nemo was boldly rushing  to the very south of the Atlantic.   During the above mentioned nineteen days no particular  incident occurred. I saw little of the captain. He was     822 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   working. I often found books in the library that he had  left open. Sometimes I heard the melancholy tones of his  organ, which he played with much expression, but at night  only, amidst the most secret obscurity, when the Nautilus  was sleeping in the deserts of the ocean.   During this part of the voyage we went along for whole  days on the surface of the waves. The sea was abandoned.  A few sailing vessels only were to be seen, bound for the  Indies, and making for the Cape of Good Hope. One day  we were pursued by the boats of a whaler that had doubtless  taken us for some enormous whale of great value. But  Captain Nemo did not wish the brave fellows to lose their  time and trouble, and he ended the pursuit by plunging  under the water.   The fish observed by Conseil and me during this period  differed little from those we had already studied under other  latitudes. We, however, came across hound-fish, whose  main characteristic is their voraciousness. The accounts  fishermen give of them may be disbelieved, but they say  that the head of a buffalo and an entire calf have been found  in the body of one of these animals ; in another, two tunny-  fish and a sailor in uniform ; in another, a soldier and his  sword j and lastly, in another, a horse and his rider. All  this certainly is not an article of faith. All I can affirm  is that the nets of the Nautilus never caught one of these  animals, so that I could not verify their voracity.   Elegant and playful shoals of dolphins accompanied us for  whole days. They went in bands of five and six, hunting in  packs like wolves j they are no less voracious than hound-  fish, if I may believe a Copenhagen professor who drew from  the stomach of a dolphin thirteen porpoises and fifteen  seals.   I also noticed in these seas some specimens resembling  perch. It is said of these that they sing melodiously, and  that their united voices form a concert that no chorus of  human voices could equal. I do not say that it is not so,  but these syrens gave us no serenade on our passage, which  I regret.   In short, to end with, Conseil classified a great quantity of  flying-fish. Nothing was more curious than to see the dol-     UNDER THE SEA 223   phins give chase to them with marvellous precision. How-  ever high it flew, even over the Nautilus the unfortunate  fish always found a dolphin's mouth open to receive it.  They were kite-gurnards with luminous mouths, which  during the night, after having striped the atmosphere with  fire, plunged into the dark waters like so many shooting-  stars.   Until the i3th of March our navigation went on under the  same conditions. That day the Nautilus was employed in  sounding experiments that greatly interested me.   We had then come nearly 13,000 leagues since our depar-  ture from the high seas of the Pacific. We were on the spot  where Lieutenant Parker, of the American frigate Congress,  was not able to reach the submarine depths with a line of  7,600 fathoms.   Captain Nemo resolved to send his Nautilus to the very  bottom in order to verify these different soundings. I pre-  pared to take notes of the result. The saloon panels were  opened, and the manoeuvres necessary to reach such prodi-  gious depths were begun.   It will be readily imagined that the filling of the reser-  voirs would not suffice. They would probably not have  sufficiently increased the specific weight of the Nautilus.  Besides, to go up again it would have been necessary to get  rid of the extra stock of water, and the pumps would not  have been powerful enough to conquer the exterior pressure.   Captain Nemo resolved to seek the oceanic bottom by a  sufficiently elongated diagonal by means of his lateral planes,  which were inclined to an angle of 45 with the water-lines  of the Nautilus. Then the screw was worked at its maxi-  mum of speed, and its quadruple branch beat the water  with indescribable violence.   Under this powerful propulsion the hull of the Nautilus  vibrated like a sonorous wire and sank regularly under the  water. The captain and I, in the saloon, followed the needle  of the manometer that rapidly moved. We had soon  passed the habitable zone where most of the fish dwell.  Some can only live on the surface of seas or rivers, whilst  others, less numerous, inhabit greater depths. Amongst  these latter I noticed a species of sea-hound, furnished with     224 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   six gills ; the enormous-eyed telescope ; the cuirassed malar-  mat, with grey thorax, black pectorals which protected his  chest-plate of pale red bony plates and lastly, the grena-  dier, which, living at a depth of six hundred fathoms, sup-  ports a pressure of a hundred and twenty atmospheres.   I looked at the manometer. The instrument indicated  a depth of 3,000 fathoms. Our submersion had lasted an  hour. The Nautilus, gliding on its inclined planes, was  still sinking. The quiet water was surprisingly trans-  parent. An hour later we were at a depth of 6,500  fathoms about three leagues and a quarter and still  there was no sign of the bottom.   However, at a depth of 7,000 fathoms I perceived some  blackish summits rise amidst the waters. But these  summits might belong to mountains as high as the Hima-  layas or Mont Blanc, higher even, and the depth of these  abysses remains unknown.   The Nautilus sank still lower, in spite of the powerful  pressure it endured. I felt the steel plates tremble under  the jointures of their bolts ; its bars bent ; its partitions  groaned ; the windows of the saloon seemed to curve under  the pressure of the water. And the apparatus would doubt-  less have been crushed in, if, as the captain said, it had not  been as capable of resistance as a solid block.   Whilst skirting the declivity of these rocks, lost under  the water, I still saw some shells, serpulse, and spinorbis,  still living, and some specimens of asteriads.   At 8,000 fathoms down we had passed the limits of sub-  marine existence, like a balloon that rises above the respir-  able atmosphere.    What a situation !  I cried.  To traverse these  deep regions to which man has never reached ! Look,  captain, look at those magnificent rocks, those uninhabited  grottoes, those last receptacles of the globe where life is  no longer possible 1 What unknown sites, and why must  we be forced to keep nothing of them but the remem-  brance?     Should you like to take away anything better than the  remembrance ?  asked Captain Nemo.    What do you mean ?      UNDER THE SEA 225    I mean that nothing is easier than to take a photographic  view of this submarine region !    I had not time to express the surprise that this fresh  proposition caused me before, at an order from Captain  Nemo, a camera was brought into the saloon. Through  the wide-opened panels the liquid, lighted up by electricity,  was distributed with perfect clearness. No shade, not a  gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light. The  sun would not have been more favourable to an operation  of this nature. The Nautilus, under the propulsion of its  screw, mastered by the inclination of its planes, remained  motionless. The camera was pointed at these sites on  the oceanic bottom, and in a few seconds we had obtained  an exceedingly pure negative.   The positive I give here. Here may be seen the primor-  dial rocks that have never known the light of heaven, the  lower granites that form the powerful foundation of the  globe, the profound grottoes dug out of the stony mass, the  outlines of such incomparable clearness, the border-  lines of which stand out black as if due to the brush of  certain Flemish artists. Then, beyond, an horizon of  mountains, an admirable undulated line composing the  background of the landscape. I cannot describe the  effect of these smooth black polished rocks, destitute of  moss, without a stain, and with such strange forms solidly  resting on the carpet of sand that sparkled in the electric  light.   However, after Captain Nemo had terminated his opera-  tion, he said to me    We must go up again now, professor. It would not do  to expose the Nautilus too long to such pressure.    Go up again !  I expostulated.    Hold tight.   I had not time to understand why the captain gave me  this caution before I was thrown upon the carpet.   At a signal from the captain the screw had been shipped,  the planes raised vertically, and the Nautilus, carried up  like a balloon into the air, shot along with stunning rapidity.  It cut through the water with a sonorous vibration. No  detail was visible. In four minutes it had cleared the four     26 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   leagues that separated it from the surface of the ocean,  and after emerging like a flying fish it fell again, making  the waves rebound to an enormous height.     CHAPTER XII   CACHALOTS AND WHALES   DURING the night, from the I3th to the I4th of March,  the Nautilus resumed her southerly direction. I thought  that, once abreast of Cape Horn, the head would be turned  westward, so as to make for the seas of the Pacific, and so  complete its voyage round the world. Nothing of the  kind was done, however, and the vessel kept on its way to  the most southerly regions. Where was it going ? To the  Pole ? That was madness ! I began to think that the  daring of the captain justified Ned Land's fears.   For some time past the Canadian had not spoken to me  about his projects of flight. He had become less com-  municative, almost silent. I could see how much this  prolonged imprisonment was weighing upon him. I felt  how his anger was accumulating. When he met the  captain his eyes lighted up with sombre fire, and I always  feared that his natural violence would lead him into some  extreme.   That day, the I4th of March, Conseil and he came into  my room to find me. I asked them the reason for their  visit.    I have a simple question to ask you, sir, answered the  Canadian.    Speak, Ned.    How many men do you think there are on board the  Nautilus ?    ' I cannot say, my friend, but certainly ten, and that is  enough to overpower us three. Therefore, my poor Ned,  I can only preach patience to you.   And even more than patience, answered Conseil   resignation too.   Conseil had used the right word.    After all, he continued,  Captain Nemo cannot     UNDER THE SEA 227   always go southward ! He must stop somewhere, if only  before an ice-bank, and afterwards he will return to more  civilised seas ! It will then be time to return to Ned  Land's projects.   The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across  his forehead, and left the room without answering.    Will monsieur allow me to make one observation ?   said Conseil.  That poor Ned thinks of everything he  cannot have. Everything in his past life comes back to him.  Everything we are forbidden seems to him regrettable. His  old recollections oppress him and make him heartsick. It is  easy to understand. What has he to do here ? Nothing.  He is not learned like monsieur, and cannot have the same  taste for the beauties of the sea as we have. He would risk  all to be able once more to enter a tavern in his own country.    It is certain that the monotonous life on board must  appear insupportable to the Canadian, accustomed as he  was to a free and active life. The events he could take an  interest in were rare. However, that day an event did  happen that recalled the bright days of the harpooner.   While we were seated on the platform with a quiet sea, the  Canadian signalled a whale on the eastern horizon. Look-  ing attentively, we could see its black back rise and fall  above the waves at five miles' distance from the Nautilus.    Ah !  cried Ned Land,  if I was on board a whaler now  what pleasure that sight would give me ! It is one of  large size. Look with what strength its blow-holes throw  up columns of air and vapour ! Confound it all ! Why  am I chained to this piece of iron ?     What, Ned !  said I,  you have not yet got over your  old fishing ideas ?     Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir ? Can  he ever tire of the emotions of such a chase ?     Have you never fished in these seas, Ned ?     Never, sir. Only in the Arctic Seas, and as much in  Behring as in Davis Straits.    Then the southern whale is still unknown to you. It is  the Greenland whale you have hunted up till now ; it  would not venture to pass through the warm water at the  equator.     228 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Ah, professor, what are you talking about ?  replied  the Canadian in a passably incredulous tone.    About what really exists.    Well, all I know is that I myself in '65 that is, two  years and a half ago I harpooned a whale near Greenland  that carried in its side a pointed harpoon of a Behring  whaler. Now I ask you, sir, how could it, after being struck  on the west coast of America, come to the east coast to be  killed unless it had either doubled Cape Horn or the Cape of  Good Hope, and so crossed the equator ?     I think like Ned, said Conseil,  and I await mon-  sieur's answer.    Monsieur will answer you, my friend, that whales are  localised, according to their kinds, in Certain seas that they  do not leave. And if one of these creatures went from  Behring to Davis Straits, it must be simply because there  is a passage from one sea to the other, either on the coasts  of America or Asia.    Must I believe you ?  asked the Canadian, wink-  ing.    Monsieur must be believed, answered Conseil.    In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do  not know what sort of whales frequent them.    I have told you so, Ned.    More reason for making their acquaintance, said  Conseil.    Look ! look !  cried the Canadian excitedly. It is  coming nearer ! It is coming up to us ! It sets me at  defiance ! It knows I can do nothing to it !    Ned stamped. His hand trembled as he brandished an  imaginary harpoon.    Are these whales as big as those in the north seas ?   he asked.    About the same, Ned.    Because I have seen large whales, sir whales a hundred  feet long.    That seems to me exaggerated. These creatures are  only like cachalots, and are generally much smaller than  the ordinary whale.    Ah !  cried the Canadian, whose eyes never left the     UNDER THE SEA 229   ocean,  it is coming nearer ; it is coming into the water of  the Nautilus.   Then resuming the conversation    You speak of the cachalot, said he,  as though it was  a small creature. They talk, however, of gigantic ones.  Some of them, they say, are such intelligent monsters that  they cover themselves with sea-weed and are taken for  islands. People encamp on them, settle, light fires     And build houses, said Conseil.    Yes, joker, answered Ned Land.  Then one fine day  the animal plunges and drags all its inhabitants to the  bottom of the sea.    Like the voyages of Sinbad the sailor, replied I,  laughing.  Ah, Ned, it appears that you like extraordin-  ary tales ! What cachalots yours are ! I hope you do  not believe in them.    Mr. Naturalist, answered the Canadian seriously,   everything about whales may be believed. What a rate  this one is going at ! They make out that these creatures  can go round the world in a fortnight.     I do not contradict the statement.    But what you very likely do not know, M. Aronnax, is  that, in the beginning of the world, whales went along  more rapidly still.   Really, Ned! How so?    Because then their tails were like fishes' tails that is to  say, that compressed vertically they struck the water from  right to left and from left to right. But the Creator, per-  ceiving that they went along too quickly, bent their tails,  and from that time they beat the water from top to bot-  tom to the detriment of their speed.    Good, Ned, said I, adopting one of his expressions ;   must I believe you ?     Not altogether, answered Ned Land,  and not more  than if I told you that there exist whales three hundred  feet long, and weighing a hundred thousand pounds.    That is a good deal, certainly, I said.  Still it must  be acknowledged that there are cetaceans of extraordinary  development, since they can give as much as a hundred and  twenty tons of oil.     230 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    As to that, I have seen it, said the Canadian.    I readily believe it, Ned, as I believe that some whales  are as large as a hundred elephants. Judge of the effect of  such a mass hurled at fuU speed.    Is it true, asked Conseil,  that they can sink ships ?     Not ships, I believe, answered I.  Still it is related  that in 1820, precisely in these southern seas, a whale  threw itself upon the Essex and sank the vessel almost  immediately.   Ned looked at me with a bantering air.    For my part, said he, I have had a blow from a  whale's tail in my boat, of course. My companions  and I were thrown up to a height of twenty feet. But  mine was only an infant whale in comparison to yours.    Ah !  cried Ned, looking ahead again,  it is not one  whale, but ten, twenty, a whole troop of them ! And I  can't do anything ! I'm bound hand and foot !    Without saying another word he lowered himself through  the panel, and ran to seek the captain's permission for a  hunt. A short time afterwards both appeared on the  platform.   Captain Nemo looked at the troop of cetaceans that were  playing on the waters about a mile from the Nautilus.    They are austral whales, he said.  There's the  fortune of a fleet of whalers there.    Well, sir, asked the Canadian,  can't I pursue them  just to prevent myself forgetting my old trade of har-  pooner ?     What is the use ?  answered Captain Nemo.  We  have no use for whale-oil on board.    But, sir, resumed the Canadian,  you allowed us to  pursue a dugong in the Red Sea !     That was to procure fresh meat for my crew. Here  it would only be for the pleasure of killing. I know that  it is a privilege reserved to man, but I do not approve of  such a murderous pastime. By destroying the austral  as well as the ordinary whale, both inoffensive creatures,  people like you, Ned Land, commit a sin. They have  quite enough of their natural enemies, the cachalots, sword-  fish and saw-fish, without your interfering.     UNDER THE SEA 231   I leave the Canadian's face during this moral lecture to be  imagined. It was a waste of words to give such reasons to  a sportsman. Ned Land looked at Captain Nemo, and  evidently did not understand what he meant. However,  the captain was right. The barbarous and inconsiderate  greed of the fishermen will one day cause the last whale to  disappear from the ocean.   Ned Land whistled  Yankee Doodle  between his  teeth, and turned his back upon us.   However, Captain Nemo looked at the troop of cetaceans,  and addressing me    I was right in saying whales had enough natural  enemies. They will have plenty to do before long. Do  you see those black moving points, M. Aronnax, about  eight miles to leeward ?     Yes, captain, I replied.    They are cachalots terrible animals that I have  sometimes met with in troops of two or three hundred.  As to those cruel and mischievous creatures, it is right to  exterminate them.   The Canadian turned quickly at these last words.    Well, captain, I said,  in the interest of the whales  there is still time.    It is useless to expose oneself, professor. The Nautilus  will suffice to disperse these cachalots. It is armed with a  steel spur that I imagine is quite worth Mr. Land's harpoon.   The Canadian did not repress a shrug of the shoulders.  Attack cetaceans with a prow ! Who had ever heard of  such a thing ?    Wait, M. Aronnax, said Captain Nemo.  We will  show you a hunt you have never seen before. I have no  pity for such ferocious cetaceans. They are all mouth  and teeth.   Mouth and teeth ! The cachalot could not be better  described ; it is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long.  Its enormous head takes up one-third of its entire body.  Better armed than the whale, whose upper jaw is only  furnished with whalebone, it is supplied with twenty-five  large tusks, about three inches long, weighing two pounds  each. The cachalot is an ugly animal, more of a tadpole     232 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   than a fish, according to Frdol's description. It is badly  formed, the whole of the left side being what we might call  a  failure, and seeing little except with the right eye.   In the meantime the formidable troop was drawing  nearer. They had perceived the whales, and were preparing  to attack them. One could prophesy beforehand that the  cachalots would be victorious, not only because they were  better built for attack than their inoffensive adversaries, but  also because they could remain longer under the waves  without rising to the surface.   There was only just time to go to the help of the whales  when the Nautilus came up to them. The Nautilus sank ;  Conseil, Ned, and I took our places at the windows of  the saloon. Captain Nemo joined the helmsman in his  cage to work his apparatus as an engine of destruction.  I soon felt the vibration of the screw increase and our  speed become greater.   The combat between the cachalots and whales had already  begun when the Nautilus reached them. It was worked  so as to divide the cachalots, who at first showed no fear  at the sight of the new monster joining in the conflict.  But they soon had to guard against its blows.   What a struggle ! Ned Land himself, soon enthusiastic,  ended by clapping his hands. The Nautilus was now  nothing but a formidable harpoon, brandished by the hand  of its captain. It hurled itself against the fleshy mass, cut  it through from end to end, leaving behind it two quivering  halves of an animal. It did not feel the formidable blows  on its sides from the cachalots' tails, nor the shocks it  produced itself. One cachalot exterminated, it ran to  another, tacked on the spot that it might not miss its prey,  going backwards and forwards obedient to its helm, plung-  ing when the cetacean dived into deep water, coming  back with it to the surface, striking it in front or sideways  cutting or tearing in all directions and at any pace, piercing  it through with its terrible spur.   What carnage ! What a noise on the surface of the  waves ! What sharp hissing and snorting, peculiar to  these animals when frightened ! Amidst these generally  peaceful waters their tails made perfect billows.     UNDER THE SEA 233   For an hour this Homeric massacre went on, which the  cachalots could not escape. Ten or twelve of them tried  several times to crush the Nautilus under their mass. We  saw through the window their enormous mouths, studded  with teeth, and their formidable eyes. Ned Land, who  could no longer contain himself, threatened and stormed at  them. We could feel them clinging to our vessel, like dogs  worrying a wild boar in a copse. But the Nautilus, forcing  its screw, carried them hither and thither, or to the upper  level of the waters, in spite of their enormous weight or  powerful hold.   At last the mass of cachalots was broken up, the waves  became quiet again, and I felt that we were rising to the sur-  face of the ocean. The panel was opened, and we rushed  on to the platform.   The sea was covered with mutilated bodies. A formid-  able explosion could not have cut up these fleshy masses  more effectually. We were floating amidst gigantic bodies,  bluish on the back, whitish underneath, covered with  enormous protuberances. Some terrified cachalots were  darting away on the horizon. The waves were dyed red  for several miles round, and the Nautilus was floating in a  sea of blood.   Captain Nemo joined us.    Well, Mr. Land ?  said he.    Well, sir, answered the Canadian, whose enthusiasm  had calmed down,  it is a terrible spectacle, certainly.  But I am not a butcher I am a hunter, and this is only  butchery.    It is a massacre of mischievous animals, replied the  captain,  and the Nautilus is not a butcher's knife.    I like my harpoon better, answered the Canadian.    Each to his arm, replied the captain, looking fixedly  at Ned Land.   I feared that the Canadian would give way to some act of  violence that would have deplorable consequences. But  his anger was averted by the sight of a whale which the  Nautilus had just come up with.   The animal had not been able to escape the cachalots'  teeth. It was lying on its side, its belly riddled with holes     234 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   from the bites, and quite dead. From its mutilated fin  still hung a young whale that it had not been able to save  from the massacre. Its open mouth let the water run in and  out, which murmured through the whale's bones like waves  breaking on the shore.   Captain Nemo steamed the Nautilus close to the body ol  the animal. Two of his men mounted on the whale's  side, and I saw, not without astonishment, that they  were drawing from its udders all the milk they contained  that is to say, about two or three tons.   The captain offered me a cup of this milk, which was still  warm. I could not help showing him my repugnance to  this drink. He assured me that it was excellent, and not  to be distinguished from cow's milk.   I tasted it, and was of his opinion. It was a useful  reserve for us, for this milk under the form of butter or  cheese would make an agreeable variety to our daily food.   From that day I noticed, with uneasiness, that Ned  Land's ill-will for the captain increased, and I resolved  to watch the Canadian's doings and gestures very closely.   CHAPTER XIII   THE ICE-BANK   THE Nautilus resumed her imperturbable southwardly  course, and on the I4th of March I perceived floating ice,  forming reefs over which the sea curled. The Nautilus  kept on the surface of the ocean. Ned Land, who had  already fished in the Arctic seas, was familiar with the  spectacle of icebergs. Conseil and I were admiring it for  the first time.   In the air, towards the southern horizon, stretched a  white band of dazzling aspect. English whalers have given  it the name of  ice-blink. However thick the clouds  may be, they cannot hide it ; it announces the presence  of an ice-pack or bank.   In fact, larger blocks soon appeared, the brilliancy of  which was modified according to the caprices of the mist.  Some of these masses showed green veins, as if the long  undulating lines had been traced by sulphate of copper.     UNDER THE SEA 235   Others, like enormous amethysts, let the light shine through  them. Some reflected the rays of the sun upon a thousand  crystal facets.   The more we went down south the more these floating  islands gained in number and importance. The Polar birds  rested on them by thousands ; petrels, danners, and  puffins deafened us with their cries. Some of them took  the Nautilus for the body of a whale, came upon it to rest,  and pecked its plates with their beaks.   During this navigation amidst the ice Captain Nemo  often kept on the platform. Directing his Nautilus with  consummate skill, he cleverly avoided the shock of those  masses, some of which were several miles long and from  200 to 300 feet high. The horizon often appeared entirely  closed up. At the height of the sixtieth degree of latitude  all passage had disappeared. But Captain Nemo, by care-  ful search, soon found some narrow opening through which  he audaciously glided, knowing well, however, that it  closed up behind him.   The temperature was rather low. The thermometer,  exposed to the exterior air, indicated two or three degrees  below zero. But we were warmly dressed in furs that seals  or Polar bears had furnished us with. The interior of the  Nautilus, regularly heated by its electrical apparatus,  defied the most intense cold. Besides it had only to sink  some yards below the surface to find a supportable tem-  perature. Two months earlier we should have experienced  perpetual daylight in these latitudes ; but we had already  three or four hours' night, and by-and-by there would be  six months of darkness in these regions.   On the i5th of March we passed the latitude of the New  Shetland and New Orkney Islands. The captain informed  me that formerly numerous tribes of seals inhabited them ;  but the English and American whalers, in their rage for de-  struction, massacred even mothers with young, and left the  silence of death where life and animation formerly existed.   On the i6th of March, about 8 a.m., the Nautilus, crossed  the Antarctic Polar Circle. Ice surrounded us on every side  and closed the horizon. Still Captain Nemo went through  one passage after another, and still more southward.     236 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Where can he be going to ?  I asked.    He is following his nose, answered Conseil.  After  all, when he cannot go any further he will stop.    I would not swear to that !  I answered. And, to  tell the truth, I must acknowledge that this adventurous  excursion did not displease me. I cannot express my  astonishment at the beauties of these new regions. The ice  took most superb form. Here the grouping formed an  Oriental town, there an overturned city, looking as if  thrown to the earth by some earthquake aspects inces-  santly varied by the oblique rays of the sun or lost in the  grey mists amidst snowstorms. Detonations and ice-slips  were heard on all sides great overthrows of icebergs that  -changed the scene like the landscape of a diorama.   When the Nautilus was submerged at the moment that  these equilibriums w r ere disturbed, the noise was pro-  pagated under the water with frightful intensity, and the  fall of the masses created fearful eddies as far as the greatest  depths of the ocean. The Nautilus then pitched and  tossed like a ship given up to the fury of the elements.   On the i6th of March ice-fields absolutely barricaded the  road. This obstacle could not stop Captain Nemo, and he  threw himself against the ice-field with frightful violence.  The Nautilus entered the brittle mass like a wedge, and  split it up with a frightful cracking noise. It was the  ancient battering-ram hurled by infinite power. Pieces of  ice, thrown high in the air, fell in hail around us. By its  single power of impulsion our apparatus made a canal for  itself. Sometimes by the force of its own impetus it  fell on the ice-field and crushed it with its weight, or, deeply  engaged in the ice, it divided it by a simple pitching move-  ment that opened up wide fissures in it.   At length, on the i8th of March, after many useless  assaults, the Nautilus was positively blocked up. It was  no longer stopped by either streams, packs, or ice-fields,  but an immovable barrier, formed by icebergs soldered  together.    The ice-bank !  said the Canadian to me.   I understood that to Ned Land, like all the navigators     UNDER THE SEA 237   who had preceded us, this was an insuperable obstacle.  The sun having appeared for an instant about noon, the  captain took a pretty exact observation, which gave our  bearings by 51 30' of long, and 67 39' of south lat. It was  already a very high point in these Antarctic regions.   There was no longer the slightest appearance of sea or  liquid surface before our eyes. Under the prow of the  Nautilus stretched a vast plain covered with confused  blocks, looking like the surface of a river some time before  the breaking up of the ice, but on a gigantic scale. Here  and there sharp peaks and slender needles rismg to a height  of two hundred feet ; farther, a line of cliffs with precipitous  sides, covered with greyish tints, vast mirrors that reflected  a few rays of the sun, half-drowned in the mists. Then  over this desolate scene a savage silence, scarcely broken  by the flapping of petrels' or puffins' wings. All was frozen,  even sound.   The Nautilus was then obliged to stop in its adventurous  course amidst the ice-fields.    Sir, said Ned Land to me one day,  if your captain  goes any farther     WeU ?     He will be a clever man.    Why, Ned ?     Because no one can pass the ice-bank. He is powerful,  your captain, but, confound it ! he is not more power  than Nature, and where it has put limits he must stop  whether he likes it or not.    That's certain, Ned Land, and yet I should like to  know what is behind that ice-bank 1 A wall j that is  what irritates me the most.    Monsieur is right, said Conseil.  Walls have only  been invented to irritate scientists. There ought to be walls  nowhere.    Well, said the Canadian,  it is well known what is  behind the ice-bank.    What ?  I asked.    Ice, ice, and nothing but ice !    You are certain of that fact, Ned, I replied,  but I am  not. That is why I should like to go and see.     238 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Well, professor, answered the Canadian,  give up the  idea. You have reached the ice-bank, which is already  sufficient, and you won't go any further, either you, Captain  Nemo, or his Nautilus. And whether he likes it or no, we  will have to go up north again that is to say, to the coun-  try of honest folks.   I ought to acknowledge that Ned was right, and until  vessels are made to navigate on ice-fields they must stop  at the ice-bank.   In fact, notwithstanding all its efforts, notwithstanding  the powerful means employed to break up the ice, the  Nautilus was brought to a standstill. Generally, if you  cannot go any further, all you have to do is to go back.  But here going back was as impossible as going on, for the  passages had closed up behind us, and if our apparatus  remained stationary long it would soon be blocked up.  That is what happened about 2 p.m., and the young ice  formed on its sides with astonishing rapidity. I was  forced to acknowledge that Captain Nemo's conduct was  more than imprudent. I was at that moment on the plat-  form. The captain, who had been observing the situation  for some minutes, said to me    Well, professor, what do you think of it ?     I think we are caught, captain.    Caught ? What do you mean by that ?     I mean that we cannot go either backwards or forwards.  I believe that is what may be called caught, at least, on  inhabited continents.    Then, M. Aronnax, you do not think the Nautilus can  be set free ?     Not easily, captain, for the season is already too far ad-  vanced for you to depend upon the breaking up of the ice.    Ah, professor !  answered the captain in an ironical  tone,  you are always the same ! You only see obstacles  and difficulties. But I affirm to you that not only will the  Nautilus be set free, but it will go farther still !     Farther south ?  I asked, looking at the captain.    Yes, sir, it will go to the Pole.    To the Pole !  I cried, unable to restrain a movement  of incredulity     UNDER THE SEA 239    Yes, replied the captain coldly,  to the Antarctic  Pole, to that unknown point where all the meridians of the  globe meet. You know whether I do all I please with the  Nautilus.   Yes. I knew it. I knew that man pushed boldness to  temerity. But was it not an enterprise absolutely insane,   It then came into my head to ask Captain Nemo if he had  already discovered this Pole, which no human being had set  foot upon.    No, professor, he answered,  and we will discover it  together. I have never brought my Nautilus so far south j  but, I repeat, it shall go farther still.    I wish to believe you, captain, said I in a slightly  ironical tone.  I do believe you ! We will break up  that ice-bank, and if it resists, we will give the Nautilus  wings so that we can pass over it !     Over it, professor ?  answered Captain Nemo tran-  quilly.  No, not over it, but under it.    Under it 1  I cried.   A sudden revelation of the captain's projects illuminated  my mind. I understood. The marvellous qualities of the  Nautilus would again be of service in this superhuman  enterprise.    I see that we begin to understand each other, pro-  fessor, said the captain, half smiling.  You already  catch a glimpse of the possibility I say of the success  of this attempt. What is impracticable to an ordinary  ship is easy to the Nautilus. If a continent emerges at the  Pole, it will stop before that continent, But if, on the  contrary, the Pole is bathed by the open sea, the Nautilus  will go to the Pole itself.    It is certain, said I, carried along by the captain's  reasoning,  that though the surface of the sea is solidified  by ice, its depths are free on account of the providential  reason that has placed the maximum of density of sea-  water at a superior degree to its congelation. And if I am  not mistaken, the submerged part of this ice-bank is to the  emerged part as four is to one.    About that, professor. For every foot that icebergs  have above the sea they have three below. Now as these     240 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   mountains of ice are 300 feet high, they are not more than  900 deep. Well, what is 900 feet to the Nautilus ?     Nothing, captain.    It might even go and seek at a greater depth the uni-  form temperature of sea-water, and there we could brave  with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of cold on the  surface.    True, sir, very true, I answered, getting animated.    The only difficulty, continued Captain Nemo,  will  be to remain submerged for several days without renewing  the air.    Is that all ?  I replied.  The Nautilus contains vast  reservoirs ; we will fill them, and they will furnish us with  all the oxygen we shall want.    Well imagined, M. Aronnax, said the captain, smiling.   But I did not wish you to accuse me of foolhardiness, so I  submit all objections to you beforehand.    Have you any more to make ?     One only. It is possible that if sea exists at the South  Pole, that sea may be entirely frozen over, and conse-  quently we cannot go up to the surface.    Well, sir, do you forget that the Nautilus is armed with  a powerful prow, and can we not hurl it diagonally against  the icefields, which will open at the shock ?     Ah, professor, you have some good ideas to-day !     Besides, captain, said I, getting more and more  enthusiastic, why should we not find an open sea at the  South as well as at the North Pole ? The cold poles and the  poles of the globe are not the same either in the boreal or  austral hemispheres, and until we get proofs to the contrary  we may suppose there is either a continent or an ocean  free from ice at these two points of the globe.    I think so too, M. Aronnax, answered Captain Nemo.   I will only observe to you that after uttering so many  objections to my scheme, you now crush me with arguments  in favour of it.   Captain Nemo spoke truly. I had come to rival him in  audacity ! It was I who was dragging him to the Pole !  I outdistanced him. But no, poor fool ! Captain Nemo  knew the for and against better than you, and was amusing     UNDER THE SEA 241   himself with seeing you carried away by your dreams of the  impossible.   In the meantime he had not lost an instant. At a signal  the first officer appeared. These two men spoke rapidly  in their incomprehensible language, and whether it was  that the first officer had been told of it beforehand, or that  he found the scheme practicable, he manifested no surprise.   The preparations for this audacious attempt were now  begun. The powerful pumps of the Nautilus were working  air into the reservoirs, and storing it at high pressure.  About four o'clock Captain Nemo informed me that the  panels of the platform were going to be closed. I threw  a last look at the thick ice-bank we were going to pass.  The weather was clear, the atmosphere pure, and the  cold very piercing, twelve degrees below zero ; but the  wind had lulled, and this temperature did not seem  unbearable.   About ten men got up on the sides of the Nautilus, and,  armed with pickaxes, broke the ice round the hull, which  was soon set free. This was a speedy operation, for the  young ice was still thin. We all went back into the interior.  The usual reservoirs were filled with the liberated water,  and the Nautilus soon sank.   I had taken my place with Conseil in the saloon. Through  the open window we watched the different depths of the  Southern Ocean. The thermometer rose. The needle  of the manometer deviated on its dial.   At a depth of nine hundred feet, as Captain Nemo had  foreseen, we were floating under the undulated surface of  the ice-bank. But the Nautilus sank lower still. It reached  a depth of four hundred fathoms. All the manoeuvres were  accomplished with extraordinary precision.    We shall pass it, if monsieur will allow me to say so,  said Conseil.    I count upon it, I answered in a tone of profound  conviction.   Under the sea, the Nautilus had gone the direct road to  the Pole straight along the fifty-second meridian. There  remained from 67 30' to 90, twenty-two and a half de-  grees to cross that is to say, rather more than five     242 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   hundred leagues. The Nautilus went at an average speed  of twenty -six miles an hour. If it kept it up forty hours  that time would be enough to reach the Pole.   During a part of the night the novelty of the situation  kept us at the window. The sea was lighted up by the  electric lantern. Fish did not sojourn in these imprisoned  waters. They only used them as a passage to go from the  Antarctic Ocean to the open sea at the Pole. Our speed  was rapid. We felt it by the vibrations of our long steel  hull.   About 2 a.m. I went to take a few hours' rest. Conseil  did the same. Going through the waist I did not meet  Captain Nemo. I supposed that he was in the helmsman's  cage.   The next day, March igth, at 5 a.m., I went back to my  station in the saloon. The electric log indicated that the  speed of the Nautilus had only been moderate. It was then  going up towards the surface, but prudently, by slowly  emptying its reservoirs.   My heart beat quickly. Were we going to emerge and  find the free atmosphere of the Pole ?   No. A shock told me that the Nautilus had struck  against the bottom of the ice-bank, still very thick, to  judge by the dulness of the sound. We had struck at a  depth of 1,000 feet. That gave 2,000 feet above us, 1,000  feet of which was emerged. The ice-bank, therefore, was  higher than it was on its border a not very reassuring fact.   During that day the Nautilus several times recommenced  the same experiment, and always struck against the wall  that hung above it like a ceiling.   In the evening no change had occurred in our situation.  Still ice between two and three hundred fathoms deep an  evident diminution, but what thickness there still was  between us and the surface of the ocean !   It was then 8 p.m. According to the daily custom on  board the air ought to have been renewed four hours before.  I did not suffer from it much, although Captain Nemo had  not yet drawn upon his reservoirs for a supplement of  oxygen.   My sleep was restless that night. Hope and fear be-     UNDER THE SEA 243   sieged me by turns. I rose several times. The gropings  of the Nautilus were still going on. About 3 a.m. I noticed  that the lower surface of the ice-bank was met with at a  depth of only twenty-five fathoms. A hundred and fifty  feet next separated us from the surface of the water. The  ice-bank was gradually becoming an ice-field. The moun-  tain was becoming a plain.   My eyes no longer left the manometer. We were still  ascending, diagonally fjllowing the brilliant surface that  shone under the rays of the electric lamp. The ice-bank  was getting lower above and below in long slopes. It got  thinner from mile to mile.   At last, at 6 a.m. on this memorable igth of March, the  door of the saloon opened. Captain Nemo appeared.    The open sea !  he said.   CHAPTER XIV   THE SOUTH POLE   I RUSHED upon the platform. Yes ! There lay the open  sea. A few pieces of ice and moving icebergs were scattered  about ; in the distance a long stretch of sea j a world of  birds in the air, and myriads of fish in the waters, which,  according to their depth, varied from intense blue to olive  green. The thermometer marked three degrees centigrade  above zero. It was like a relative spring inclosed behind  this ice-bank, whose distant masses were outlined on the  northern horizon.    Are we at the Pole ?  I asked the captain, with a  palpitating heart.    I do not know yet, he answered.  At noon we will  take our bearing.    But will the sun show itself through these mists ?  said  I, looking at the grey sky.    However little it shows, it will be enough for me, an-  swered the captain.   About ten miles south of the Nautilus a solitary island  rose to a height of six hundred feet. We were bearing  down upon it, but prudently, for the sea migrht be strewn  with reefs.   R     244 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   An hour afterwards we had reached the islet. Two hours  later we had been round it. It measured from four to five  miles in circumference. A narrow channel separated it  from a considerable stretch of land, perhaps a continent,  the limits of which we could not perceive.   The Nautilus, for fear of being stranded, had stopped at  three cables' length from a beach, over which rose a superb  heap of rocks. The boat was launched. The captain,  two of his men carrying the instruments, Conseil, and I  embarked. It was 10 a.m. I had not seen Ned Land.  The Canadian, doubtless, did not wish to acknowledge  himself in the wrong in the presence of the South Pole.   A few strokes of the oars brought the boat on to the sand,  where it stranded. As Conseil was going to jump out I  stopped him.    Captain Nemo, said I,  to you belongs the honour  of first setting foot on this land.    Yes, professor, answered the captain,  and I do not  hesitate to do so, because, until now, no human being has  left the imprint of his footsteps upon it.   That said he jumped lightly on to the sand. Keen emo-  tion made his heart beat faster. He climbed a rock which  overhung, forming a small promontory, and there, with his  arms crossed, mute and motionless, he seemed to take  possession with an eager look of these southern regions.  After five minutes passed in this rapt contemplation he  turned towards us.    When you are ready, professor, he called to me.   I disembarked, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men  in the boat.   For some distance the soil was composed of a reddish  colour, as if it had been made of crushed bricks. Lava  streams, and pumice-stone covered it. Its volcanic origin  could not be mistaken. In certain places some slight curls  of smoke attested that the interior fires still kept their  expansive force. Still, when I had climbed a high cliff, I  saw no volcano within a radius of several miles.   While the vegetation of this desolate continent seemed  to me very restricted, in the air life was superabundant.  There thousands of birds of all kinds fluttered and flew     UNDER THE SEA 245   about, deafening us with their cries. Others crowded the  rocks, gazing at us, as we passed, without fear, and pressing  familiarity under our feet. There were penguins as agile and  supple in the water as they are heavy and clumsy on land.  They uttered harsh sounds, and formed numerous assem-  blies, sober in gesture, but prodigal of clamour.   There was the chionis of the long-legged family, as large  as pigeons, white, with short conical beaks, and a red circle  round the eye. Conseil made a provision of them, for,  suitably dressed, they make an agreeable dish. In the air  passed albatrosses, the expanse of whose wings measured at  least four yards and a half, justly called ocean vultures j  gigantic petrels, that are great seal-eaters j damiers, a kind  of small duck, the top of whose body is black and white j  and, lastly, a whole series of petrels, some whitish, with  brown-bordered wings, others blue, and special to the  Antaractic seas.  These petrels are so oily, I remarked  to Conseil,  that the inhabitants of the Feroe Islands con-  tent themselves with putting a wick inside them, and then  lighting it.    A little more, said Conseil,  and they would be  perfect lamps. Ah, why did not Nature supply the wick ?/'   About a half-a-mile farther on the soil was riddled with  ruffs' nests j it was a sort of laying ground from which  many birds issued. Captain Nemo had some hundreds  killed, for their blackish flesh is very good. They uttered  a cry like the braying of an ass, were about the size of a  goose, slate-colour on the body, white underneath, with  a yellow cravat round their throats. They let themselves  be killed with stones without trying to escape.   In the meantime the mist was not rising, and at n a.m.,  the sun had not yet made its appearance. Its absence made  me uneasy. Without it there was no observation possible.  How, then, could we settle whether we had reached the  Pole ?   When I rejoined Captain Nemo I found him silently  leaning against a rock, and looking at the sky. He seemed  impatient and vexed. But there was no help for it. This  powerful and audacious man could not command the sun  like he did the sea.     246 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Twelve o'clock came without the sun having showed itself  for a single instant. Even the place it occupied behind the  curtain of mist could not be distinguished. The mist  soon after dissolved in snow.    We must wait till to-morrow, said the captain simply,  and we went back to the Nautilus amidst the snow.   During our absence the nets had been set, and I noticed  with interest the fish that had just been caught. The  Antarctic seas are a refuge to a great number of migratory  fish that fly from the tempests of the less elevated zones to  fall under the teeth of seals and sea-hogs. I noticed  several austral bull-heads three inches long, a species of  whitish cartilaginous fish, crossed with pale bands, and  armed with darts also Antarctic chimera three feet long, a  very elongated body, white skin, silvery and smooth, with a  rounded head, a back furnished with three fins, the snout  ending in a trumpet that curled back towards the mouth.  I tasted them, and found them insipid, notwithstanding  Conseil's opinion, who found them very good.   The snow-storm lasted until the next day. It was im-  possible to keep upon the platform. From the saloon,  where I was taking notes of the incidents of this excursion,  to the Polar continent, I heard the cries of petrels and alba-  trosses playing amidst the tempest. The Nautilus did not  remain motionless, and, coasting the continent, it went  about ten miles farther south in the sort of twilight that  the sun left as it skirted the horizon.   The next day, the 2oth of March, the snow had ceased.  It was slightly colder. The thermometer indicated two  degrees below zero. The mists rose, and I hoped it would  be possible to take an observation that day.   Captain Nemo not having yet appeared, the boat took  Conseil and me to the land. The nature of the soil was the  same volcanic. Everywhere traces of lava, scoriae, basalts,  but no trace of the crater from which they issued. Here,  as there, myriads of birds animated this part of the Polar  continent but they divided this empire with vast troops of  seals and walruses of different sorts, some lying on the  ground, some on floating pieces of ice, several coming out  of the sea or plunging into it. They did not run away at     UNDER THE SEA 247   our approach, never having had to do with man, and I  counted enough for the provisioning of some hundreds of  ships.    Faith, said Conseil,  it is a good thing that Ned Land  did not accompany us !     Why so, Conseil ?     Because the rabid sportsman would kill all the seals.    All is saying a great deal, but I do not really think we  could have prevented him killing some of these magnificent  cetaceans, which would have offended Captain Nemo, for  he does not uselessly spill the blood of inoffensive creatures.    He is right.    Certainly, Conseil. But have you not already classified  some specimens of this marine fauna ?     Monsieur knows very well that I am not strong in  practice. When monsieur has told me the names of these  creatures     They are seals and walruses. They are divided into  species, and unless I am mistaken we shall have an  opportunity of observing them here. Let us go on.   It was 8 a.m. We had four hours to employ before the  sun could be usefully observed. I guided our steps towards  a vast bay that was hollowed out of the granitic cliff of the  shore.   There I may say that as far as the eye could reach, land  and ice were covered with marine mammalia, and I looked  involuntarily for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd who  watched over these immense flocks of Neptune. There  were more seals than anything else, forming distinct groups,  male and female, the father watching over his family, the  mother suckling her little ones, some already strong  enough to go a few steps. When they wish to move from  place to place they take little jumps, made by the con-  traction of their bodies, and helped awkwardly by their  one imperfect fin, which, forms a perfect fore-arm. I ought  to say that in the water, their natural element, these  animals, with their mobile dorsal spine.with smooth and close  skin and webbed feet, swim admirably. When resting on  the earth they take the most graceful attitudes. Thus the  ancients, observing their soft and expressive looks, which     248 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can  give their clear, voluptuous eyes, and their charming  positions, turning them into poetry, metamorphosed the  males into tritons and the females into syrens.   I made Conseil notice the large development of the lobes  of the brain in these interesting creatures. No mammal,  except man, has so much cerebral matter. Seals are cap-  able of receiving a certain amount of education, are easily  tamed, and I think, with other naturalists, that if properly  trained they might render good service as fishing-  dogs.   The greater part of these seals slept on the rocks or  sand. Amongst those seals, properly so called, which have  no external ears in which they differ from the otter, whose  ears are prominent I noticed several varieties of steno-  rhynchi, about nine feet long, with white coats, bull-dog  heads armed with ten teeth in either jaw, four incisive ones  top and bottom, and two large canine teeth. Amongst  them glided marine elephants a sort of seals with short and  mobile trumpets (the giants of the species), which on a  circumference of twenty feet measured ten metres. They  made no movement at our approach.    Are they dangerous animals ?  asked Conseil.    No, I answered,  unless they are attacked. When a  seal is defending its young its fury is terrible, and it is not  rare for it to break fishing-boats in pieces.    It has the right to do it.    I do not say no.   Two miles farther on we were stopped by a promontory  which sheltered the bay against the south winds. It fell  straight down into the sea, and was covered with foam  from the waves. Beyond we heard formidable bellowings,  as though from a herd of oxen.   ' Good, said Conseil   are we in for a bull's concert ?    ' No, said I,  but a walrus's concert.   ' Are they fighting ?    ' Either fighting or playing.   ' If monsieur pleases we must see that.   ' We must, Conseil.   And we crossed the black rocks, amidst unforeseen land-     UNDER THE SEA 249   slips and over stones that the ice made very slippery. More  than once I slipped, and bruised myself rather painfully  for' the moment. Conseil, more prudent or steadier, hardly  stumbled, and helped me up again, saying    If monsieur would be good enough to walk with his legs  farther apart, monsieur would keep his balance better.   After we had reached the top of the promontory I per-  ceived a vast white plain covered with walruses. They  were playing and howling with joy, and not anger.   Walruses resemble seals in the form of their bodies and  the position of their limbs. But both canine and incisive  teeth are wanting in their lower jaw, and the upper canines  are two defences a yard long which measure thirty-two feet  to the circumference of their socket. These tusks made  of compact ivory, harder than that of elephants and less  subject to go yellow are much sought after. Accordingly  walruses are much hunted, and their destroyers, massacring  indiscriminately females with young and young ones,  destroy more than four thousand every year.   Passing near these curious animals I had full leisure to  observe them, for they looked upon us with indifference.  Their skins were thick and rugged, of a fawn-colour inclining  to red ; their hair was short and scanty ; some were twelve  feet long. Quieter and less timid than their congeners of  the north, they did not confide to picked sentinels the care  of watching the approaches to their encampment.   After having examined this city of walruses I thought of  retracing my steps. It was eleven o'clock, and if Captain  Nemo found he could take an observation I wished to be  present at his operation. However, I hardly expected  that the sun would show itself that day ; piled-up clouds on  the horizon hid him from our sight. It seemed as if the  jealous planet would not reveal to human beings the unavoid-  able point of the globe.   However, I thought of returning to the Nautilus. We  were following a narrow track that ran up to the summit ot  the cliff. At half-past eleven we had reached the spot where  we landed. The stranded boat had landed the captain. I  perceived him standing on a block of basalt. His instru-  ments were by him. His eyes were fixed on the northern     250 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   horizon, above which the sun was describing his elongated  curve.   I stood near him and waited without speaking. Twelve  o'clock came, and, like the day before, the sun did not  appear.   It was most annoying. If the observation was not  taken to-morrow we would be unable to definitely ascertain  our position, whether we had actually reached the Pole.   In fact, we were at the 20th of March. The next day,  the 2ist, was the day of the equinox, and the refraction not  counting, the sun would disappear below the horizon for  six months, and with its disappearance the long Polar night  would begin. Since the September equinox it had been  above the northern horizon, rising by elongated spirals  until the 2ist of December. At that epoch, the summer  solstice of these austral countries, it had begun to sink,  and the next day it would shoot forth its last rays.   I communicated my fears to Captain Nemo.    You are right, M. Aronnax, said he ; if to-morrow  I do not obtain the height of the sun I cannot do it again  for six months. But just because the chances of my navi-  gation have brought me into these seas on the 2ist of  March, my point will be easy to take if the sun will reveal  himself at noon.    Why, captain ?     Because while the sun is describing such elongated  curves it is difficult to take its exact height above the  horizon, and the instruments are liable to commit grave  errors.    How shall you proceed, then ?     I shall only use my chronometer, answered Captain  Nemo.  If to-morrow, the 2ist of March, at noon, the  sun's disc, allowing for refraction, is exactly cut by the  northern horizon, it is because I am at the South Pole.   ' That is certain, said I ;  yet that affirmation is not  mathematically rigorous, because the equinox does not  necessarily begin at twelve o'clock.    Doubtless, professor ; but there will not be an error of  a hundred yards, and that is all we require. Till to-morrow,  then.     UNDER THE SEA 251   Captain Nemo returned on board. Conseil and I re-  mained till five o'clock, walking about the shore, observ-  ing and studying. I found nothing curious but a pen-  guin's egg of remarkable size that an amateur would have  paid 40 for. Its fawn colour, and the stripes and char-  acters that covered it like so many hieroglyphics, made it a  curiosity. I entrusted it to Conseil, and the prudent, sure-  footed fellow, holding it like a piece of china porcelain,  brought it to the Nautilus intact.   There I placed the rare egg under one of the glass cases  of the museum. For supper I had an excellent morsel of  seal's liver, the taste of which was like pork. Then I went  to bed, not without having invoked, like a Hindoo, the  favour of the radiant planet.   Early next morning I went up to the platform and found  Captain Nemo there.    The weather is clearing up a little, said he. I  have great hopes of it. After breakfast we will land and  choose a post of observation.   This agreed upon, I went to Ned Land and tried to per-  suade him to come with me. The obstinate Canadian re-  fused, and I saw that his taciturnity, like his bad temper,  increased every day. After all I did not much regret his  obstinacy in this circumstance. There were really too  many seals on land, and such a temptation should not be  placed before the unreflecting fisher.   Breakfast over, I landed. The Nautilus had gone forty  miles farther south still during the night. It was at a  good league from the coast, which rose to an abrupt peak  of i, 600 feet. The boat carried also Captain Nemo, two of  his crew, and the instruments that is to say, a chrono-  meter, a telescope, and a barometer.   During our passage I saw numerous whales. These  powerful animals could be heard at a great distance when  they threw up columns of air and steam into the air, which  resemble torrents of smoke. These different mammalia  were disporting themselves in troops in the quiet waters,  and I could see that this basin of the Antarctic Pole now  served as a place of refuge to cetaceans too closely tracked  by hunters     252 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   We landed at nine o'clock. The sky was getting clearer   the clouds were flying south. The mists were rising from  the cold surface of the water. Captain Nemo walked to-  wards the peak, of which he doubtless meant to make his  observatory. It was a difficult ascent over the sharp lava  and pumice-stones, in an atmosphere often saturated  with a sulphurous smell from the smoking fissures. For a  man unaccustomed to tread on land the captain climbed  the steep slopes with an agility that I could not equal and  that a chamois-hunter might have envied.   It took us two hours to get to the summit of this peak.  From there the view comprised a vast expanse of sea which  on the north distinctly traced its horizon-line on the sky.  At our feet lay fields of dazzling whiteness ; over our heads  a pale azure free from mist. On the north lay the sun's  disc, like a ball of fire, already sinking below the horizon.  From the bosom of the waters rose hundreds of sparkling  fountains. In the distance lay the Nautilus, like a monster  asleep ; behind us, on the south and east, an immense  stretch of land, a chaotic heap of rocks and icebergs, the  limits of which were not visible.   When Captain Nemo reached the top he carefully took  its height by means of the barometer, for he would have to  take it into consideration in making his observation.   At a quarter to twelve the sun, then only seen by refrac-  tion, looked like a golden disc, shedding its last rays over  these lands and seas which man had never before ploughed.   Captain Nemo, provided with a reticulated glass which,  by means of a mirror, corrected the refraction, watched the  sun as it disappeared gradually below-.the horizon describing  an elongated diagonal. I held the chronometer. My heart  beat quickly. If the disappearance of half the disc coin-  cided with the noon of the chronometer, we were at the  Pole itself.    Twelve !  I cried.    The South Pole !  answered Captain Nemo in a grave  tone, giving me the glass which showed the sun cut in  exactly equal halves by the horizon.   I looked at the last rays crowning the peak, and the  shadows gradually mounting its slopes.     UNDER THE SEA 253   At that moment Captain Nemo, resting his hand on my  shoulders, dramatically declared    I, Captain Nemo, on the 2ist of March, 1868, have  reached the South Pole on the goth degree, and I take pos-  session of this part of the globe, equal to the sixth part of  known continents.    In whose name, captain ?     In my own, sir.   So saying, Captain Nemo unfurled a black flag, bearing  an N in gold, quartered on its bunting. Then, turning to-  wards the sun, whose last rays were lapping the horizon of  the sea, he exclaimed    Adieu, sun ! Disappear, thou radiant star ! Rest  beneath this free sea, and let a six months' night spread its  darkness over my new domain 1     CHAPTER XV   ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT ?   THE next day, March 22nd, at 6 a.m., preparations for de-  parture were begun. The last gleams of twilight were melt-  ing into night. The cold was intense. The constellations  shone with wonderful intensity. In the zenith glittered that  wondrous southern cross, the Polar star of Antarctic regions.  The thermometer indicated 12 below zero, and when the  wind freshened it was biting. Icebergs increased on the  open water. The sea seemed about to freeze all over.  Numerous black patches spread over the surface pointed  to the approaching formation of young ice. Evidently  the southern basin, frozen during the six winter months,  was absolutely inaccessible. What became of the whales  during that period ? They doubtless went to seek below  the ice-bank more practicable seas. As to seals and wal-  ruses, accustomed to live in the severest climates, they re-  mained in these frozen regions. These animals have the  instinct to dig holes in the ice-fields, and keep them always  opened. They come up through these holes to breathe ;     254 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   the birds, driven away by the cold, have emigrated north-  wards, and the marine mammalia remain undisputed  masters of the Polar continent.   In the meantime the reservoirs of water were being filled,  and the Nautilus was slowly sinking. It stopped at a  depth of one thousand feet. It beat the waves with its  screw, and advanced northwards at the rate of fifteen miles  an hour. Towards evening it was already floating under the  immense covering of the ice-bank.   The panels of the saloon were closed for prudence sake,  for the hull of the Nautilus might strike against some sub-  merged block, so I passed that day in writing out my notes.  I gave myself up to thoughts about the Pole. We had  reached this inaccessible point without fatigue or danger,  as if our floating carriage had glided over a railroad. And  now the return had really begun. Did it reserve any fresh  surprises for me ? I thought it might, so inexhaustible  is the series of submarine marvels ! During the five months  and a half that fate had thrown me on board this vessel,  we had come 14,000 leagues, and during this distance,  greater in extent than the terrestrial equator, how many  curious or terrible incidents had varied our voyage the  hunt in the forests of Crespo, the stranding in the Torres  Straits, the coral cemetery, the fisheries of Ceylon, the  Arabic tunnel, the fires of Santorin, the millions of Vigo  Bay, the Atlantis, the South Pole ! During the night all  these memories passed like a dream, not letting my brain  repose for an instant.   At 3 a.m. I was awakened by a violent shock. I rose up  in bed, and was listening with a feeling of alarm, when I  was bodily thrown into the middle of the room. The Nauti-  lus had evidently made a considerable rebound after hav-  ing struck.   I groped along the partition through the waist to the  saloon, which was lighted up by the luminous ceiling. The  furniture was all upset. Happily the window-sashes were  firmly set, and had stood fast. The pictures on the star-  board side, through the vessel being no longer vertical,  were sticking to the tapestry, whilst those on the larboard  side were hanging a foot from the wall at their lower edge.     UNDER THE SEA 255   The Nautilus was lying on its starboard side completely  motionless.   In the interior I heard a noise of footsteps and confused  voices. But Captain Nemo did not appear. At the  moment I was going to leave the saloon Ned Land and  Conseil entered.    What is the matter ?  asked I immediately.    I came to ask monsieur, answered Conseil.    A thousand devils !  cried the Canadian.  I know  very well what it is. The Nautilus has struck, and to judge  by the way it is lying, it won't come off quite so easily as in  Torres Straits.    But at least, I asked, js it on the surface of the sea ?     We do not know answered Conseil.    It is easy to find out, said I.   I consulted the manometer. To my great surprise it  indicated a depth of one hundred and eighty fathoms.    What can this mean ?  I exclaimed.    We must ask Captain Nemo, said Conseil.    But where shall we find him ?  asked Ned Land.    Follow me, I said to my two companions.   We left the saloon. There was no one in the library, or  on the central staircase, or in the ward-room. I supposed  that Captain Nemo must be in the helmsman's cage. The  only thing to do was to wait. We all three returned to the  saloon.   I shall pass by the Canadian's recriminations in silence.  He had now something to be in a rage about. I let him  vent his bad-humour at his ease without answering him.   We had been listening for twenty minutes to the least  noise in the interior of the Nautilus, when Captain Nemo  entered. He did not seem to see us. His countenance,  habitually so impassive, revealed a certain anxiety. He  looked at the compass and manometer in silence, and put  his finger on a point of the planisphere in that part that  represented the South Seas.   I did not wish to interrupt him. When, a few instants  afterwards, he turned towards me, I said to him, using an  expression he had used in Torres Straits    An incident, captain ?      256 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   ' No, professor, he replied.  An accident this time/   ' Grave ?    ' Perhaps.   ' Is the danger immediate ?    ' No.   ' The Nautilus has been struck ?    ' Yes.   ' How ?    ' Through a caprice of Nature, not through the in-  capacity of man. There has not been a fault committed in  our manoeuvres. But no one can prevent equilibrium  producing its effects. We may resist human laws, but we  cannot stand against natural ones.   Captain Nemo chose a singular moment to utter this  philosophical reflection. On the whole, his answer  taught me nothing.    May I know, sir, I asked,  the cause of this acci-  dent ?     An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain, has  turned over, he answered.  When icebergs are under-  mined by warmer water or reiterated shocks, their centre  of gravity ascends. Then the whole thing turns over.  That is what has happened. One of these blocks as it  turned over struck the Nautilus, which was floating under  the waters. Then gliding under its hull, and raising it with  irresistible force, it has raised it to less dense waters, and  thrown it on its side.    But cannot the Nautilus be got off by employing the  reservoirs so as to restore its balance ?     That is. what they are doing now, sir. You can hear the  pump working. Look at the needle of the manometer. It  indicates that the Nautilus is ascending, but the block of  ice is ascending with it, and until some obstacle stops its  upward movement our position will not be changed.   The Nautilus still kept the same position. It would,  doubtless, right itself when the block itself stopped. But at  that moment how did we know that we should not strike  against the ice-bank and so be frightfully squeezed between  the two frozen surfaces ?  I reflected on all the consequences of this situation.     UNDER THE SEA 257   Captain Nemo did not cease to watch the manometer.  The Nautilus, since the fall of the iceberg, had ascended  about one hundred and fifty feet, but it still kept the same  perpendicular angle.   Suddenly a slight movement was felt in the hull. The  Nautilus was evidently righting itself a little. The objects  hung up in the saloon were slowly recovering their normal  position. The partitions became more vertical. No one  spoke. Excitedly we watched the vessel right itself.  The flooring became horizontal under our feet. Ten minutes  went by.    At last we are straight !  I exclaimed.    Yes, said Captain Nemo, going towards the door of  the saloon.    But shall we get afloat again ?  I asked him.    Certainly, he answered assuringly.   The captain went out, and I soon saw that, following his  orders, they had stopped the ascension of the Nautilus,  In fact, it would soon have struck against the bottom of the  ice-bank, and it was better to keep it in the water.    We have had a narrow escape !  then said Conseil.    Yes. We might have been crushed between two  blocks of ice, or, at least, imprisoned. And then, not   being able to renew the air Yes, we have had a   narrow escape !     If that is all !  murmured Ned Land.   I did not wish to begin a useless discussion with the  Canadian, so did not answer him. Besides, at that moment  the panels of the saloon were opened and the electric light  shone through the glass panes.   We were in full water, as I have said ; but at a distance  of thirty feet on each side of the Nautilus rose a dazzling  wall of ice. Above and below the same wall. Above, be-  cause the bottom of the ice-bank formed an immense ceil-  ing. Below, because the overturned block, gliding down  by degrees, had found on the lateral walls two resting-places  which kept it in that position. The Nautilus was impri-  soned in a veritable tunnel of ice, about sixty feet wide,  filled with tranquil water. It would, therefore, be easy  for it to go out of it by going either backwards or forwards,     258 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   and finding, at some hundreds of feet lower down, a free  passage under the ice-bank.   The luminous ceiling had been put out, and still the  saloon was filled with intense light. It was because the  powerful reflection from the walls of ice sent the light of the  lantern into it with violence. I could not paint the effect  of the voltaic rays of light on these capriciously-formed  blocks, of which each angle, each point, each facet, threw  a different light according to the veins in the ice. A  dazzling mine of gems, and particularly of sapphires which  crossed their blue rays with the green rays of the emeralds.  Here and there opal shades of infinite softness ran amidst  ardent points like so many fiery diamonds and the scene  was so brilliant that it dazzled our eyes. The power of the  lantern was increased a hundredfold like that of a lamp  through first-class lenticular lighthouse glasses.    Oh, how beautiful ! How beautiful !  exclaimed  Conseil.    Yes !  said I.  It is an admirable sight. Is it not,  Ned ?     Yes, a thousand devils ! Yes, answered Ned Land.   It is superb. I'm in a rage at being obliged to acknow-  ledge it. No one has ever seen anything like it. But we  may have to pay dearly for the sight. And I believe that  here we see things God never meant us to see.   Ned was right. It was too beautiful. All at once a  cry from Conseil made me turn round.    What is the matter ?  I asked.    Let monsieur close his eyes and not look !    So saying, Conseil quickly carried his hand to his  eyes.    But what has happened, my boy ?     I am dazzled blinded.   My eyes involuntarily turned to the window, but I could  not bear the fire that devoured them.   I understood what had happened. The Nautilus had  Just put on full speed. All the tranquil brilliancy of the  ice-walls had then changed into flashes of lightning. The  fires of these myriads of diamonds were united together.   The panels of the saloon were then closed. We held our     UNDER THE SEA 259   hands to our eyes, which were uncomfortably painful and  some time elapsed before we gained our normal sight.   At last we lowered our hands.    Faith, I could never have believed it, said Conseil.    And I don't believe it yet, answered the Canadian.    When we return to land, added Conseil,  familiar  with so many marvels of Nature, what shall we think of the  miserable continents and little works done by the hand of  man ? No, the inhabited world is no longer worthy of us.   Such words from the mouth of an impassive Dutchman  showed to what a boiling point our enthusiasm had reached.  But the Canadian did not fail to throw cold water on it.    The inhabited world !  said he, shaking his head.   Don't be uneasy, friend Conseil, we shall never see that  again.   It was then 5 a.m. At that moment a shock took place  in the bows of the Nautilus. I knew that its prow had  struck against a block of ice. This, I thought, must be a  mistaken manoeuvre, for the submarine tunnel, obstructed  here and there, was not easily navigated. I therefore  imagined that Captain Nemo, changing his direction, would  turn around these obstacles, or follow the series of bends of  the tunnel. In any case our forward journey could not be  quite prevented. Still, contrary to my expectation, the  Nautilus began a decided retrograde movement. ,    We are going backwards ?  said Conseil.    Yes, I answered,  the tunnel must be without issue  on that side.    And what will be done then ?     Then, I said,  the manoeuvre is very simple. We  shall retrace our steps and get out by the southern opening,  that is all.   In pronouncing so decided an opinion I wished to appear  more confident than I really was. In the meantime the  backward movement of the Nautilus was getting more rapid,  and with reversed screw it was carrying us along with great  rapidity.    This will cause a delay, said Ned.    What do a few hours more or less matter, so that we get   out ?    s     260 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Yes, echoed Ned Land,  so that we get out.   I walked backwards and forwards for some minutes  between the saloon and the library. My companions also  were silent. I soon threw myself upon a divan, and took a  book which my eyes ran over mechanically.   A quarter of an hour afterwards Conseil came up to me  and said    Is what monsieur is reading very interesting ?     Very interesting, I replied.    I thought so. It is monsieur's book that monsieur is  reading !    My book ?    In fact, I held in my hand the work on the Submarine  Depths. I had not the least idea of it. I closed the book  and resumed my walk. Ned and Conseil rose to go.    Stay, my friends, I said, at the same time gently  placing my hands on Conseil's shoulders.  Let us remain  together till we are out of this tunnel.    As monsieur pleases, answered Conseil.   Some hours passed. I often looked at the instruments  hung up on the walls of the saloon. The manometer in-  dicated that the Nautilus kept at a constant depth of nine  hundred feet, the compass that we were going south, the  log that our speed was twenty miles an hour an excessive  speed in that narrow space. But Captain Nemo knew that  he could not make too much haste, and that now minutes  were worth centuries.   At twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took  place, this time at the back. I turned pale. My com-  panions came up to me. I seized Conseil's hand. We  questioned each other with a look which bespoke our  thoughts of fear.   At that moment the captain entered the saloon. I  went to him.    The route is barricaded on the south ?  I asked.    Yes, sir. As the iceberg turned over it entirely barred  the way.    Then we are blocked up ?     Yes.     UNDER THE SEA 261   CHAPTER XVI   WANT OF AIR   THE Nautilus was completely embedded in a rock of ice  We were imprisoned in the ice-bank. The Canadian  struck a vicious blow on the table with his fist. Conseil  said nothing. I looked at the captain. His face had regained  its usual impassiveness. He had crossed his arms over  his breast and was reflecting. The Nautilus was quite still.   The captain then spoke.    Gentlemen, said he, in a calm voice,  there are two  ways of dying under our present circumstances.   This inexplicable personage looked like a professor of  mathematics stating a problem to his pupils.    The first, he continued,  is to be crushed to death ;  the second is to be suffocated. I need not speak of the  possibility of dying of hunger, for the provisions of the  Nautilus will certainly outlast us.    We cannot be suffocated, captain, I answered,  for  our reservoirs are full.    True, said Captain Nemo,  but they will only give  us air for two days. Now we have already been six-and-  thirty hours under water, and the heavy atmosphere of  the Nautilus already wants renewing. In forty-eight hours  our reserve will be exhausted.    Well, captain, we must get out before forty-eight hours.    We will try, at all events, by piercing through the wall  that surrounds us.    On which side ?  I asked.    The bore will tell us that. I am going to run the  Nautilus on to the lower bank, and my men will put on  their diving-dresses and attack the wall where it is the  least thick.    Can we have the saloon panels opened ?     Certainly ; we are no longer moving.   Captain Nemo went out. A hissing sound soon told me  that the reservoirs were being filled with water. The  Nautilus gradually sank, and rested on the ice at a depth of  175 fathoms.     262 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    My friends, said I,  the situation is grave, but I  count on your courage and energy.    Sir, answered the Canadian,  it is not the time to  worry you with my grumbling. I am ready to do any-  thing for the common safety.    That is right, Ned, said I, holding out my hand to  the Canadian.    I am as handy with the pickaxe as the harpoon, he  added,  and if I can be useful to the captain he may de-  pend upon me.    He will not refuse your aid. Come, Ned.   I led the Canadian to the room where the men of the  Nautilus were putting on their diving-dresses. I told the  captain of Ned's proposition, which was accepted. The  Canadian put on his sea-costume, and \vas ready as soon as  his companions. Each wore a breathing apparatus on  his back, to which the reservoirs had furnished a supply of  pure air a considerable but necessary diminution to the  reserve of the Nautilus.   When Ned was dressed I went back to the saloon, where  the panels were open, and, taking a place beside Conseil, I  took stock of the situation with a feeling of alarm.   Some moments after we saw a dozen men of the crew step  out on to the ice with Ned Land amongst them, recognisable  from his tall stature. Captain Nemo was with them.   Before beginning to dig through the walls he had them  bored to assure a good direction to the work. Long bores  were sunk into the lateral walls, but after forty-five feet  they were again stopped by a thick wall. It was useless  to attack the ice-ceiling, for it was the ice-bank itself,  which was more than 1,200 feet high. Captain Nemo  then had the lower surface bored. There thirty feet of ice  separated us from the water, such was the thickness of this  ice-field. It was, therefore, necessary to cut away a part  equal in extent to the water-line of the Nautilus. There  were, therefore, about 7,000 cubic yards to detach in order  to dig a hole through which we could sink below the ice-field.   The work was immediately begun and carried on with  indefatigable energy. Instead of digging round the Nautilus  which would have been exceedingly difficult, Captain     UNDER THE SEA 263   Nemo had an immense trench made, about eight yards  from its port quarter. Then his men began simultaneously  to work at it in different points of its circumference, and  large blocks were soon detached from the mass. By a curi-  ous effect of specific gravity, these blocks, being lighter than  water, fled up to the vault of the tunnel, whieh thus be-  came thicker at the top as it became thinner at the bottom.  But it was of no consequence so long as the bottom ice was  reduced in thickness.   After two hours of energetic work Ned Land entered ex-  hausted. His companions and he were relieved by fresh  workers, whom Conseil and I joined. The first officer of  the Nautilus directed us.   The water seemed to me singularly cold, but I soon grew  warmer with handling the pickaxe. My movements were  very free, though made under a pressure of thirty atmo-  spheres.   When I re-entered, after two hours of work, to take  food and rest, I found a notable difference between the air  the breathing apparatus furnished me with and the atmo-  sphere of the Nautilus, already loaded with carbonic acid  gas. The air had not been renewed for forty-eight hours,  and its life-giving qualities were considerably weakened.  However, in twelve hours we had broken off a slice of ice a  yard thick, or about six hundred cubic yards. Admitting  that we could go on at the same rate, it would take still  five nights and four days to accomplish our task.    Five nights and four days 1  said I to my companions,   and we have only air for two days in the reservoirs.    Without reckoning, replied Ned,  that, once out of  this confounded tomb, we shall still be imprisoned under  the ice-bank without any possible communication with  the atmosphere !    True enough. Who could then foresee the minimum of  time necessary for our deliverance ? Should we not all be  suffocated before the Nautilus could reach the surface of the  waves ? Was it destined to perish in this tomb of ice with  all the people it contained ? The situation appeared  terrible, but each of us looked it bravely in the face, and  we were all decided to do our duty to the end.     264 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   As I had foreseen, during the night another slice, a yard  thick, was dug off the immense cell. But in the morning,  when, clothed in my bathing-dress, I walked in the liquid  mass in a temperature of from 6 to 7 below zero, I re-  marked that the lateral walls were gradually approaching  each other. The water away from the trench, which was  not warmed by the men's work and the play of the tools,  showed a tendency to solidify. In presence of this new  and imminent danger what chance of safety had we, and  how could we prevent the solidification of this liquid medium  that would have crushed the sides of the Nautilus like  glass ?   I did not make known this new danger to my compan-  ions. Why risk the damping of that energy which they  were employing in their painful toil ? But when I went  back on board I spoke to Captain Nemo about this grave  complication.    I know it, he said in his calm tone, which no terrible  conjuncture of circumstances could modify.  It is one  danger more, but I see no means of avoiding it. The only  chance of safety is to work quicker than the solidification.  We must be first, that is all.    Be there first !  I ought by now to be accustomed  to this way of speaking.   That day I handled the pickaxe vigorously for several  hours. The work kept me up. Besides, to work was to  leave the Nautilus and breathe the pure air drawn directly  from the reservoirs and furnished by the apparatus, and to  leave the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere of the  vessel.   Towards evening the trench had been dug another yard  deeper. When I went back on board I was nearly suffoca-  ted with the carbonic acid with which the air was filled.  Ah ! had we not the chemical means to drive away this  deleterious gas ? We had abundance of oxygen the  water contained a considerable quantity and by decom-  pounding it with our powerful piles we could restore the  vivifying fluid. I had thought of it, but what was the use,  since the carbonic acid made by our breathing had invaded  all parts of the vessel ? In order to absorb it we should     UNDER THE SEA 265   have to fill vessels with caustic potash and shake them in-  cessantly. Now this substance was entirely wanting on  board, and nothing could take its place.   That evening Captain Nemo was obliged to open the taps  of his reservoirs and throw some columns of pure air into  the interior of the Nautilus. Without that precaution  we should never have awakened.   The next day, the 26th of March, I went on with my  mining work. The lateral walls and lower surface of the  ice-bank thickened perceptibly. It was evident that  they would come together before the Nautilus could be  extricated. Despair came over me for an instant. My  axe nearly dropped from my hands. What was the use  of digging if I was to perish suffocated, crushed by the  water that was turning to stone ? a death that even the  ferocity of savages would not have invented. It seemed  to me that I was between the formidable jaws of a monster,  which were irresistibly closing.   At that moment Captain Nemo, directing the work and  working himself, passed close to me. I touched him, and  pointed to the walls of our prison. The port wall had ad-  vanced to within four yards of the Nautilus.   The captain understood me and signed to me to follow  him. We re-entered the vessel. Once my diving-dress off,  I accompanied him into the saloon.    M. Aronnax, said he,  we must try some heroic means  or we shall be sealed up in this freezing water as in cement.    Yes, said I,  but what can we do ?     Ah !  cried he, if the Nautilus were but strong  enough to support the pressure without being crushed !     What then ?  I asked, not seizing the captain's idea.    Do you not understand, he continued,  that this  congelation of water will help us ? Do you not see that  by its solidification it will break up the ice-fields that  imprison us, as in freezing it breaks up the hardest stones ?  Do you not see that it would be an agent of salvation  instead of an agent of destruction ?     Yes, captain, perhaps. But however capable the  Nautilus may be of resisting pressure, it could not bear that,  and would be crushed as flat as a steel plate.     266 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    I know it, sir ; therefore we must not count upon  Nature for help, but upon ourselves. We must prevent  this solidification. Not only are the lateral walls closing  up, but there does not remain ten feet of water either fore  or aft of the Nautilus. It is freezing on all sides of us.    How much longer, I asked,  shall we have air to  breathe on board ?    The captain looked me full in the face.    The day after to-morrow, he said,  the reservoirs will  be empty.   I broke out into a cold perspiration. And yet ought I  to have been astonished at this answer ? On the 22nd of  March the Nautilus had sunk below the free waters of the  Pole. We were now the 26th. We had been living for  five days on the vessel's reserves, and what remained of  unpolluted air must be kept for the workers. Now, whilst  I am writing this, my impression of it is still so acute that  an involuntary terror takes possession of my whole being,  and air seems wanting to my lungs.   In the meantime Captain Nemo was reflecting, silent and  motionless. It was visible that his mind had grasped an  idea. But he seemed to be driving it away. He answered  himself in the negative. At last these words escaped from  his lips :    Boiling water !  murmured he.    Boiling water ?  I cried.    Yes, sir. We are inclosed in a relatively restricted  space. Would not some jets of boiling water, constantly  injected by the pumps of the Nautilus, raise the tempera-  ture of this medium, and delay its congelation ?     It must be tried, said I resolutely.    We will try it, professor.   The thermometer then indicated seven degrees outside.  Captain Nemo took me to the kitchens, where vast distilling  apparatus was at work, which furnished drinking-water by  evaporation. It was filled with water, and all the electric  heat of the piles was put into the serpentines, bathed by the  liquid. In a few moments the water had attained 100.  It was sent to the pumps, while fresh water constantly sup-  plied its place. The heat given off by the piles was such     UNDER THE SEA 267   that the cold water taken from the sea after going through  the apparatus arrived boiling in the pump.   The injection began, and three hours afterwards the  thermometer outside indicated six degrees below zero.  It was one degree gained. Two hours later the thermome-  ter only indicated four.    We shall succeed, I said to the captain.    I think we shall, he answered.  We shall not be  crushed. We have only suffocation to fear now.   During the night the temperature of the water went up  to one degree below zero. The apparatus could not send  it up any higher. But as sea-water does not freeze at less  than two degrees, I was at last reassured against the  danger of solidification.   The next day, the 27th of March, eighteen feet of ice had  been taken from the trench. There still remained twelve.  Another forty-eight hours' work. The air could not be  renewed in the interior of the Nautilus. That day things  went from bad to worse.   An intolerable heaviness weighed upon me. About 3  p.m. this suffocating feeling became exceedingly violent. I  dislocated my jaws with gaping. My lungs panted as they  sought the burning fluid, indispensable for respiration,  and which became more and more rarefied. A moral  torpor took possession of me. I lay down without strength  to move, almost unconscious. My brave Conseil, seized by  the same symptoms, suffering the same agony, did not  leave my side. He took my hand, encouraged me, and I  heard him murmur    Ah, if I could but do without breathing in order to  leave more air for monsieur !    Tears came into my eyes at hearing him speak about such  a sacrifice.   If our situation was intolerable in the interior, with what  haste and pleasure we donned our bathing-dresses to work  in our turn ! The pickaxes rang on the frozen surface.  Our arms were, tired, our hands skinned, but what mattered  fatigues and' wounds ? Our lungs had vital air. We  breathed ! We breathed !   And yet no one thought of prolonging his work under     268 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   water beyond his allotted time. His task accomplished,  each gave to his panting companion the reservoir that was  to pour life into him. Captain Nemo set the example,  and was the first to submit to this severe discipline. When  the time came he gave up his apparatus to another, and re-  entered the vitiated atmosphere on board, always calm,  unflinching, and uncomplaining.   That day the usual work was accomplished with still  more vigour. But six feet of ice remained. Six feet alone  separated us from the open sea. But the reservoirs of air  were almost empty. The little that remained must be  kept for the workers. Not an atom for the Nautilus.   When I re-entered the vessel I was half suffocated.  What a night ! Such suffering could not be expressed.  The next day my breathing was oppressed. Along with  pains in my head came dizziness that made a drunken man  of me. My companions felt the same symptoms. Some  of the crew had rattling in their throats.   On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain  Nemo, finding the pickaxes' work too slow, resolved to  crush in the bed of ice that still separated us from the  water. This man kept all coolness and energy. He sub-  dued physical pain by moral force. He thought, planned,  and acted.   He ordered the vessel to be lightened that is to say,  raised from the ice by a change of specific gravity. When  it floated it was towed above the immense trench dug  according to its water-line. Then its reservoirs of water  were filled ; it sank into the hole.   At that moment all the crew came on board, and the  double door of communication was shut. The Nautilus  was then resting on a sheet of ice not three feet thick,  which the bores had pierced in a thousand places.   The taps of the reservoirs were then turned full on, and a  hundred cubic yards of water rushed in, increasing by  200,000 Ibs. the Nautilus weight.   We waited and listened, forgetting our sufferings, hoping  still. We had made our last effort.   Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon felt the  vibrations in the hull of the Nautilus. A lower level was     UNDER THE SEA 269   reached. The ice cracked with a singular noise like paper  being torn, and the Nautilus sank.    We have gone through !  murmured Conseil in my  ear.   I could not answer him. I seized his hand and pressed it  convulsively.   All at once, dragged down by its fearful overweight, the  Nautilus sank like a cannon-ball that is to say, as though  it was falling in a vacuum !   Then all the electric force was put into the pumps,  which immediately began to drive the water out of the  reservoirs. After a few minutes our fall was stopped.  Soon even the manometer indicated an ascensional move-  ment. The screw, with all speed on, made the iron hull  tremble to its very bolts, and dragged us northwards.   But how long would this navigation under the ice-bank  last before we reached the open sea ? Another day ? I  would be dead by then.   Half lying on a divan in the library, I was suffocating.  My face was violet, my lips blue, my faculties suspended. I  saw nothing, heard nothing. All idea of time had disap-  peared from my mind. I could not contract my muscles.   I do not know how long this lasted. But I knew that my  death-agony had begun. I saw that I was dying. Sud-  denly I came to myself. A few whiffs of air penetrated  into my lungs. Had we, then, reached the surface of the  water ? Had we cleared the ice-bank ?   No ! Ned and Conseil, my two brave friends, were  sacrificing themselves to save me. Some atoms of air had  remained at the bottom of an apparatus. Instead of  breathing it, they had kept it for me ; and while they were  suffocating, they poured me out life drop by drop ! I  wished to push the apparatus away. They held my hands,  and for some minutes I breathed heavily.   My eyes fell on the clock. It was n a.m. It must be  the 28th of March. The Nautilus was going at a frightful  speed of forty miles an hour.   Where was Captain Nemo ? Had he succumbed ? Had  his companions died with him ?   At that moment the manometer indicated that we are     270 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   only twenty feet from the surface. A simple field of ice  separated us from the atmosphere. Could we not break  it?   Perhaps. Any way, the Nautilus was going to attempt  it. I felt that it was taking an oblique position, lowering  its stern, and raising its prow. An introduction of water  had been sufficient to disturb its equilibrium. Then, pro-  pelled by its powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from  below like a powerful battering-ram. It broke it in  slightly, then drew back, drove at full speed against the  field, which broke up, and at last, by a supreme effort, it  sprang upon the frozen surface, which it crushed under  its weight.   The panel was opened, I might say torn up, and the pure  air rushed in to all parts of the Nautilus.     CHAPTER XVII   FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON   I HAVE no idea how I got to the platform. Perhaps the  Canadian carried me there. But I was breathing, inhaling  the vivifying air of the sea. My two companions were  beside me, almost intoxicated by the sudden change.  Unfortunate men, too long deprived of food, cannot throw  themselves inconsiderately on the first aliments that are  given to them. We, on the contrary, had no reason to  restrain ourselves ; we could fill our lungs with the atoms  of this atmosphere, and it was the sea-breeze itself that was  pouring out life to us.    Ah, said Conseil,  how good oxygen is 1 Monsieur  need not fear to breathe. There is enough for every one.   Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide  enough to frighten a shark. What powerful breathing 1  The Canadian  drew  like a stove in a strong draught.   Our strength rapidly returned to us, and when I looked  around me I saw that we were alone upon the platform.  Not a man of the crew was there, not even Captain Nemo.  The strange sailors of the Nautilus contented themselves     UNDER THE SEA 271   with the air that circulated in the interior. Not one came  to take delight in the open air.   The first words I uttered were words of thanks and grati-  tude to my two companions. Ned and Conseil had pro-  longed my existence during the last hours of this agony.  All my gratitude was not too much for such self-sacrifice.    Good, professor !  answered Ned Land ;  that is not  worth speaking about. What merit had we in doing that ?  None. It was merely a question in arithmetic. Youi  existence was worth more than ours, therefore it had to be  preserved.    No, Ned, I answered,  It was not worth more. No  one is superior to a good and generous man, and that is  what you are 1 And you, my brave Conseil you have  suffered much.    Not so very much, to tell monsieur the truth. I did  want for some mouthfuls of air, but I think I should have  got used to it. Besides, I looked at monsieur, who was on  the verge of death, and that did not give me the least wish  to breathe. That stopped, as they say, my br    Conseil, confused at having fallen into such a common-  place, did not finish.    My friends, I answered, much moved,  we are bound  to one another for ever, and I am under an obligation.    Which I shall take advantage of, replied the Canadian.    What ?  said Conseil.    Yes, continued Ned Land,  by taking you with me  when I leave this infernal Nautilus.    That reminds me, said Conseil  are we going the  right way ?     Yes, I answered,  for we are going towards the sun,  and here the sun is north.    Doubtless, said Ned Land ;  but it remains to be  seen if we are making for the Pacific or the Atlantic that  is to say, the frequented or solitary seas.   That I could not answer, and I feared that Captain Nemo  would take us to that vast ocean that bathes the coasts  both of Asia and America. He would thus complete  his journey round the submarine world, and would  return to those seas where the Nautilus found the most     272 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   entire independence. But if we returned to the Pacific,  far from all inhabited land, what would become of Ned  Land's projects ?   We were soon to be apprised of this important fact. The  Nautilus was going at great speed. The Polar circle was  soon passed, and the vessel's head directed towards Cape  Horn. We were abreast of the American point on the 3ist  of March at 7 p.m.   Then all our past sufferings were forgotten. The re-  membrance of our imprisonment under the ice faded from  our minds. We only thought of the future. Captain Nemo  appeared no more either in the saloon or on the platform.  The bearings taken each day and marked upon the plani-  sphere by the first officer allowed me to tell the exact direc-  tion of the Nautilus. That evening it became evident, to  my great satisfaction, that we were going up north by the  Atlantic route.   I told the result of my observations to the Canadian and  Conseil.    Good news, said the Canadian ;  but where is the  Nautilus going to ?     I cannot tell, Ned.    Is its captain going to try the North Pole after the  South, and return to the Pacific by the famous North- West  Passage ?     It would not do to defy him to do it, answered Conseil.    Well, said the Canadian,  we would part company  beforehand.    In any case, added Conseil,  Captain Nemo is a great  man, and we shall not regret having known him.    Especially when we have left him !  answered Ned  Land.   The next day.the ist of April, when the Nautilus ascended  to the surface of the sea, some minutes before noon, we  sighted the west coast. It was Terra del Fuego, to which  the first navigators gave this name on seeing the quantity  of smoke that was rising from the native huts. This Terra  del Fuego forms a vast agglomeration of islands which  extend over a space thirty leagues long and eighty wide.  The coast appeared low to me, but in the distance rose high     UNDER THE SEA 273   mountains. I even thought I caught a glimpse of Mount  Sarmiento 6,500 feet above the sea level, a pyramidical  block of slaty rock with a very sharp summit,  which,  according as it is hidden by or free from mist, announces  fine or bad weather, said Ned Land.    A famous barometer, my friend.    Yes, sir, a natural barometer that never deceived me  when I was sailing amongst the passes in the Straits of  Magellan.   At that moment the peak stood out clearly against the  sky. It was a prophecy of good weather, and was  realised.   The Nautilus under the water, approached the shore,  which it coasted at a distance of only a few mile?. Through  the saloon windows I saw long seaweed, gigantic fucus,  and those bladder  varechs  of which the open sea at the  Pole contained a few specimens. With their slimy polished  filaments many measured as much as 900 feet in length ;  veritable cases, thicker than the thumb, and very resisting.  Another herb known under the name of  velp, with leaves  four feet long, encrusted in coralline concretions, carpeted  the bottom of the sea. They serve as nest and food to  myriads of crustaceans, molluscs, crabs, and cuttle-fish.  Seals and other animals make splendid meals, mixing fish  and sea vegetables in the English manner.   Over these fat and luxuriant depths the Nautilus passed  with extreme rapidity. Towards evening it approached  the archipelago of the Falkland Islands, of which the next  day I could recognise the steep summits. The depth  of the sea was slight ; I therefore thought not without  reason that these two islands, surrounded by many islets,  formerly formed part of the Magellan lands.   In these regions our nets brought in fine specimens of  seaweed, particularly a certain fucus the roots of which  were covered with mussels that are the best in the world.  Wild geese and ducks came down by dozens on to the plat-  form, and soon took their places in the pantries on board.  With regard to fish I specially noticed some bony speci-  mens of the goby species, and especially boulerots, six  inches long, all over yellow and white spots.     274 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   When the last heights of the Falkland group had dis-  appeared under the horizon, the Nautilus sank to a depth  of from ten to fifteen fathoms, and coasted the Ameri-  can shore. Captain Nemo did not show himself.   Until the 3rd of April we stayed in these regions of Pata-  gonia, sometimes under the ocean, sometimes on its sur-  face. The Nautilus passed the wide estuary formed by the  mouth of the La Plata, and on the 4th of April was abreast  of Uruguay, but at fifty miles' distance. Its direction  kept northwards, and it followed the long in and out course  of South America. We had then come 16,000 leagues since  we had embarked in the seas of Japan.   About ii a.m. we crossed the tropic of Capricorn on the  37th meridian, and passed abreast of Cape Frio. Captain  Nemo, to the great displeasure of Ned Land, did not like the  neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for he  passed them at a headlong speed. Not a fish nor a bird,  however rapid, could follow us, and the natural curiosities  of these seas escaped all observation.   This rapidity was kept up for several days, and on the  gth of April, in the evening, we sighted the most easterly  point of South America, that forms Cape San Roque. But  then the Nautilus went still farther out, and went to seek  at greater depths a submarine valley between that cape  and Sierra Leone on the African coast. In this place the  geological basin of the ocean forms, as far as the Lesser  Antilles, a cliff of three and a-half miles high, very steep,  and at the height of the Cape Verd Islands, another wall  no less considerable, which thus incloses all the submerged  continent of Atlantis. The bottom of that immense valley  is dotted with mountains that give a picturesque aspect to  these submarine places. I speak from the MS. charts  that were in the library of the Nautilus charts evidently  due to the hand of Captain Nemo, and drawn up from his  personal observation.   During two days these deep and solitary waters were  visited by means of the inclined planes. The Nautilus  made long diagonal broadsides, which carried it to all eleva-  tions. But on the nth of April it suddenly rose, and land  appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River.     UNDER THE SEA 275   The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west lay  the Guianas, a French territory, on which we might have  found an easy refuge. But the wind was blowing a great  gale, and the furious waves would not have allowed a simple  boat to venture on them. Ned Land doubtless understood  that, for he did not speak to me of anything. For my  part I made no allusions to his schemes for flight, for I did  not wish to urge him to make any attempt that must  inevitably fail.   I easily consoled myself for this delay by interesting  studies. During the days of the nth and I2th of April  the Nautilus did not leave the surface of the sea, and its  nets brought in a miraculous haul of zoophytes, fish, and  reptiles.   Among the fish I noticed a sort of eel, fifteen inches long,  with a greenish head, violet fins, bluish-grey back, silver-  brown belly, covered with bright spots, the pupil of the eye  encircled with gold curious animals that the current of  the Amazon must have brought down to the sea, for they  only frequent fresh water j tubercular skates with pointed  snouts, a long flexible tail, and armed with a long  saw j little sharks a yard long, with grey and whitish  skins, whose teeth in several rows are bent back, vulgarly  known as slippers  and sea-unicorns, a sort of reddish  isosceles triangle, two feet long, the pectorals of which are  attached by fleshy prolongations that make them look  like bats, but whose horny appendage, near the nostrils, has  caused to be named sea-unicorns.   One of our nets had hauled up a very flat skate, which,  if the tail had been cut off, would have formed a perfect  disc, and which weighed about 4olbs. It was white under-  neath, with reddish back, large, round, dark blue spot,  encircled with black, very smooth skin, terminating  in a bilobed fin. Laid out on the platform, it struggled,  tried by convulsive movements to turn over, and made so  many efforts that a last spring almost sent it into the sea.  But Conseil, who wished to keep the fish, rushed to it, and,  before I could prevent him, seized it with both hands.   He was immediately overthrown, with his legs in the air,  and half his body paralysed, crying   T     276 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Oh, master ! my master ! come to me !    It was the first time the poor fellow had ever spoken to  me otherwise than in the third person.   The Canadian and I picked him up, rubbed him vigor-  ously, and when he came to his senses the eternal classifier  murmured in a broken voice    Cartilaginous class, chondropterygian order, with fixed  gills, sub-order of selacians, family of ray-fish, genus of  torpedoes !     Yes, my friend, I answered,  it was an electric ray-  fish that put you in such a deplorable condition.    Ah ! monsieur may believe me, replied Conseil,  but  I will be revenged on that animal.    How ?     I'll eat it.   Which he did the same evening, but for pure vengeance,  for it was exceedingly tough.   The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a crampfish of the  most dangerous species, the cumana. This strange animal,  in a conducting medium like water, throws its electric bolts  and strikes fish at several yards' distance, so great is the  power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces of  which do not measure less than twenty -seven square  feet.   The next day, the I2th of April, during the day the Nauti-  lus approached the Dutch coast near the mouth of the  Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together.  These fine animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from eighteen  to twenty-one feet long, weigh at least 8,000 Ibs. I told  Ned Land and Conseil that foreseeing Nature had assigned  an important part to these mammalia. Like seals they are  destined to graze on the submarine meadows and thus de-  stroy the accumulation of herbs that choke up the mouth  of tropical rivers.    And do you know, I added,  what has resulted from  the almost entire destruction of these useful creatures ?  The putrefied herbs have poisoned the air, and the poisoned  air is the cause of the yellow fever that desolates these  beautiful countries. Venomous vegetation has been multi-  plied under the tropical seas, and the sickness has been irre-     UNDER THE SEA 277   sistibly developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata  to Florida !    And if Toussenel is to be believed, this plague is nothing  to the one that will fall upon our descendants when the seas  will be depopulated of whales and seals. Then they will  become vast hotbeds of infection, since their waters will no  longer possess  those vast stomachs that God had charged  to skim the surface of the sea.   However, without disdaining these theories, the crew of  the Nautilus seized a half-dozen sea-cows in order to pro-  vision the larders with excellent meat, superior to beef or  veal. Their capture was not interesting. They allowed  themselves to be struck without defending themselves.  Several thousand pounds of meat, destined to be dried,  were stored on board.   That day a singular haul again increased the reserves of  the Nautilus, so full were these seas. The net had brought  up in its meshes a number of fish, the head of which ter-  minated in an oval plate with fleshy edges. Their flat-  tened discs were composed of transverse flexible cartilagin-  ous bones by which the animal could make a vacuum, and  so adhere to any object like a cupping-glass.   The fishing ended, the Nautilus approached the coast.  In that place a certain number of marine turtles were sleep-  ing on the surface of the sea. It would have been difficult  to take any of these precious reptiles, for the least noise  wakes them, and their solid shell is proof against the har-  poon. But the echeneids causes their capture with extra-  ordinary certainty and precision. This animal is, in fact,  a living fishhook which would delight and make the fortune  of any angler.   The Nautilus's men tied a ring on the tails of these fish,  large enough not to impede their movements, and to this  ring they fastened a long cord lashed to the side of the  vessel at the other end.   The echeneids, thrown into the sea, immediately began  their work and fastened themselves on to the breastplate  of the turtles. Their tenacity was such that they would  have torn themselves to pieces rather than let go. They  were hauled on board, and with them the turtles to which  they adhered.     278 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   Thus several tortoises were taken, a yard wide, that  weighed 400 Ibs. Their shell, covered with large horny  plates, thin, transparent, and brown, with white and yellow  spots, causes them to fetch a good price. Besides, their  flesh is excellent when prepared for the table, like the com-  mon turtle, which has a delicious flavour.   That day's fishing brought our stay on the shores of the  Amazon to a close, and by nightfall the Nautilus was far  out at sea.     CHAPTER XVIII   A BATTLE WITH POULPS   FOR several days the Nautilus kept constantly away from  the American coast. The captain evidently did not wish  to frequent the waters of the Gulf of Mexico, or the seas of  the Antilles. However, there would have been plenty of  water, for the average depth of these seas is nine hundred  fathoms ; but probably these regions, strewn with islands  and ploughed by steamers, did not suit Captain Nemo.   On the 1 6th of April we sighted Martinique and Guada-  loupe, at a distance of about thirty miles. I caught a  glimpse of their high peaks.   The Canadian who counted upon putting his schemes into  execution in the Gulf, either by reaching some land or hail-  ing one of the numerous boats that coast from one island to  another, was much put out. Flight would have been very  practicable if Ned Land had been able to take possession of  the boat without the knowledge of the captain. But in  open ocean it was useless to think of it.   The Canadian, Conseil, and I, had a rather long conversa-  tion on this subject. We had been prisoners on board the  Nautilus for six months. We had come 17,000 leagues  and, as Ned Land said, there seemed no end to it. He  therefore made me a proposal that I did not expect. It was  to ask Captain Nemo, once and for all, if he meant to keep  us indefinitely in his vessel.   Such a proceeding was very repugnant to me, and I  thought it useless. It was useless to expect anything from     UNDER THE SEA 279   Captain Nemo, and we could only depend upon ourselves,  Besides, for some time past, this man had become graver,  more retiring, less social. He seemed to avoid me. I only  met him at rare intervals. Formerly he took some pleasure  in explaining the submarine marvels to me ; now he left  me to my studies and came no more to the saloon.   What change had come over him ? For what cause ?  I had nothing to reproach myself with. Perhaps our pres-  ence on board was a burden to him. However, I did not  think he was a man to restore us to liberty.   I therefore begged Ned Land to reflect well before act-  ing. If what he did had no result, it would only excite  suspicion and make our situation more painful. I may add  we had nothing to complain about on the score of our  health. If we except the rude shock it received under  the southern ice-bank, we had never been better. The  wholesome food, the salubrious atmosphere, the regular  life, the uniformity of temperature, prevented illness, and  for a man to whom the remembrance of earth left no  regret, for a Captain Nemo in his own vessel, who goes  where he likes either by mysterious means of conveyance  for others and not for himself, and goes straight to his end,  I understand such an existence. But we had not broken  all ties that bound us to humanity. For my own part, I  did not wish my curious and novel studies to be buried with  me. I had now a golden opportunity of writing a true ac-  count of the sea, and I wished for that account to appear  sooner or later.   Then again, in these seas of the Antilles, at five fathoms  below the surface, what interesting products I had to signa-  lise in my daily notes 1 There were, amongst other zoo-  phytes, a sort of large oblong bladder, with the tints of  mother-of-pearl, holding out their membranes to the wind,  and letting their blue tentacles float after them like threads  of silk charming to the eye, real nettles to the touch, that  distil a corrosive fluid. There were also animals reminding  me of the ringed earth-worm, five feet long, armed with a  pink trumpet and provided with 1,700 locomotive organs  that wind about under the water, and in passing throw out  all the colours of the rainbow. There were in the fish     280 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   category Malabar rays, enormous boneless fish ten feet long  and weighing 600 pounds, with a triangular pectoral fin,  the middle of the back slightly humped, the eyes fixed in  the extremities of the face behind the head, and which,  floating like some spar from a ship, struck on our window-  pane like an opaque shutter. There were also American  balistse, that Nature has only dressed in black and white ;  gobies long and fleshy, with yellow fins and prominent jaws ;  mackerel five feet long, with short pointed teeth, covered  with little scales. Then in swarms appeared grey mullet,  clothed in gold stripes from head to tail, turning their  shining fins veritable masterpieces of jewellery formerly  consecrated to Diana, particularly sought after by the rich  Romans, and of which the proverb said  He who takes  them does not eat them. Lastly, golden pomacanthes,  ornamented with emerald bands, dressed in velvet and silk,  passed before our eyes like Veronese seigniors ; spurred  spars swimming away with their rapid pectoral fins ; clu-  panodons, fifteen inches long, enveloped in their phosphores-  cent gleams ; mullet beating the sea with their fat fleshy  tails ; red coregonus seemed to cut the waves with their  scythe-like fins ; and silver selenes, worthy of their name,  rose on the horizon of the water like so many moons with  whitish rays.   What other marvellous and new specimens I might still  have observed had not the Nautilus sunk into lower depths I  Its inclined planes dragged it down to depths of between  1,000 and 2,000 fathoms.   On the 2oth of April we rose to an average depth of 700  fathoms. The nearest land was then the archipelago of  the Bahamas, scattered like a heap of stones on the surface  of the sea. There rose high submarine cliffs, straight walls  of corroded blocks, amongst which were black holes that  our electric rays did not light up to their depths.   These rocks were carpeted with large herbs, gigantic  fucus, hydrophytes worthy of a world of Titans.   It was about eleven o'clock when Ned Land attracted my  attention to a formidable swarming that was going on in  the large seaweed.    Well, said I,  those are veritable caverns of poulps,     UNDER THE SEA 281   and I should not be astonished to see some of those mon-  sters.    What !  ejaculated Conseil    Poulps of very large dimensions, I said.  But friend  Land is doubtless mistaken, for I see nothing.    I am sorry for that, replied Conseil.  I should like to  contemplate face to face one of those poulps I have heard so  much talk about, that can drag ships down to the bottom  of the sea. Those animals are called krakens.    No one will ever make me believe that such animals  exist, said Ned Land.    Why not ?  answered Conseil.  We all believed in  monsieur's monster whale.    We were wrong, Conseil.    Certainly, but others believe in it still.    That is probable, Conseil ; but, for my part, I am  quite decided only to admit the existence of these monsters  after I have dissected one with my own hand.    Then, asked Conseil,  monsieur does not believe in  gigantic poulps ?     Who the dickens does ?  cried the Canadian.    Many people, friend Ned.    No fishermen. Scientists do, perhaps.    Excuse me, Ned, both fishers and scientists.    But I myself, said Conseil seriously  I perfectly  recollect having seen a large vessel being dragged under the  waves by the arm of a cephalopod.    You have seen that ?  asked the Canadian.    Yes, Ned.    With your own eyes ?     With my own eyes.    And where, pray ?     At Saint Malo, replied Conseil coolly.    In the port ?  said Ned Land ironically.    No, in a church, answered Conseil.    In a church !  exclaimed the Canadian.    Yes, friend Ned. It was a picture that represented the  poulp in question.    Good !  said Ned Land, laughing.  Conseil is trying  to do me.     282 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    It is true what he says, I answered.  I have heard of  the picture, but the subject it represents is taken from a  legend, and you know what to think of legendary natural  history. Besides, when monsters are in question imagina-  tion always takes flight. Not only has it been said that  these poulps could drag down ships, but a certain authority  speaks of a cephalopod a mile long that looked more like an  island than an animal. They relate also that a certain  Bishop once raised an altar on an immense rock. His mass  ended, the rock set out and returned to the sea. The rock  was a poulp.    And is that all ?  asked the Canadian.    No, I replied.  Another bishop speaks of a poulp on  which a regiment of cavalry could manoeuvre.    Bishops did not stick at much in those days, said Ned  Land.    Lastly, the naturalists of antiquity mention monsters,  with mouths like a gulf, that were too large to pass through  the Straits of Gibraltar.    That's something like !  said the Canadian.    But in all such tales what truth is there ? asked Conseil    None, my friends at least, none where the limit of pro  bability is passed and fable or legend begins. At all events  some cause or pretext must be assigned to the imagination  of the story-tellers. It cannot be denied that poulps of  very large size exist, but they are inferior to the cetaceans.  Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a poulp as ten feet.  Our fishers frequently see them six feet long. There are  museums containing skeletons of poulps that measure six  feet. Besides, according to the calculation of naturalists, one  of these animals only six feet long has tentacles twenty-seven  feet long. That would be enough to make a formidable  monster.    Are there any caught now ?  asked the Canadian.    If they are not caught, sailors see them. One of my  friends, Captain Paul Bos, of Havre, has often affirmed to  me that he had met with one of these colossal monsters  in the Indian seas. But the most astonishing fact,  which puts the existence of these gigantic animals beyond  all doubt, occurred a few years ago in 1861.     UNDER THE SEA 283    What fact is that ?  asked Ned Land.    In 1861, in the north-east of Teneriffe, nearly in the same  latitude as we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat  Alecton perceived a monstrous poulp swimming in its waters.  The commander, Bouguer, approached the animal and  attacked it with harpoons and cannon without much  effect on the mountain of jelly. After several fruitless  attempts the crew succeeded in throwing a running noose  round the body of the mollusc ; this noose slipped down to  the caudal fins and there stopped. They tried to haul the  monster on board, but its weight was so great that the cord  cut its tail from its body, and, deprived of that ornament,  it disappeared under the water.    A fact at last, said Ned Land.    And an indisputable fact, Ned.    How long was it ?  asked the Canadian.    Did it not measure about eighteen feet ?  said Conseil,  who, posted at the window, was again examining the forma-  tion of the cliff.    Precisely, I replied.    Was not its head crowned with eight tentacles that  moved about in the water like a nest of serpents ?     Precisely.   And were not its eyes prominent and very large ?     Yes, Conseil.    And was not its mouth a veritable parrot's beak, but a  formidable beak ?     Yes, Conseil.    Well, then, if monsieur will please to come to the win-  dow, he will see, if not the poulp in question, at least one of  its brethren.   I looked at Conseil. Ned Land rushed to the window.    The frightful animal !  he cried. I looked in my turn,  and could not restrain a movement of repulsion. Before  my eyes was a monster worthy to figure in a legend.   It was a poulp of colossal dimensions, at least thirty-two  feet long. It was swimming backwards with extreme velo-  city in the direction of the Nautilus. It was staring with  its enormous green eyes ; its eight arms, or rather eight  feet, starting from its head, which have given the name of     284 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    cephalopod  to this animal, were twice as long as its body,  and twined about like the hair of the Furies. We could  distinctly see the 250 blowholes on the inner side of the ten-  tacles under the form of semispherical capsules. Sometimes  these blowholes fastened themselves on to the pane and  made a vacuum. The mouth of the monster a horned  beak made like that of a parrot opened and shut vertically.  Its tongue, a horny substance armed with several rows of  sharp teeth, came quivering out of this veritable pair of  shears. What a freak of Nature ! a bird's beak on a mol-  lusc ! Its body, shaped like a spindle and larger in the  middle, made a fleshy mass that must have weighed from  40,000 to 50,000 Ibs. Its inconstant colour, changing with  extreme rapidity according to the irritation of the animal,  passed successively from livid grey to reddish brown.   What had irritated this mollusc ? It was doubtless  the presence of this Nautilus, more formidable than  itself, upon which its suckers or mandibles had no hold.  And yet what monsters these poulps are ! what vitality  the Creator has endowed them with ! what vigour their  three hearts impart to their movements !   Chance had brought us into the presence of this creature,  and I would not lose the opportunity of carefully studying  it. I overcame the horror with which its presence inspired  me, and, taking a pencil, began to draw it.    Perhaps it is the same as the Alecton one, said Conseil.    No, answered the Canadian,  for this one is entire,  and the other had lost its tail.    That would not be a reason, I replied.  The arms and  tail of these animals grow again by redintegration, and in  seven years the tail of the Alecton one has had plenty of  time to grow.    Besides, replied Ned,  if it is not this one perhaps it is  one of those 1    In fact, other poulps had appeared at the port window. I  counted seven. They formed a procession after the Nauti-  lus, and I heard their beaks grating on the iron hull. We  had plenty to choose from.   I went on with my work. These monsters kept in our  vicinity with such precision that they seemed motionless,     UNDER THE SEA 285   and I could have drawn their outline on the window. Be-  sides, we were going at a moderate speed.   All at once the Nautilus stopped. A shock made ,it  tremble in every joint.    Can we be stranded ?  I asked.    Any way, answered the Canadian,  we must be off  again, for we are floating.   The Nautilus was certainly floating, but it was not moving  onwards. The branches of its screw were not beating the  waves. A minute passed. Captain Nemo, followed by  his first officer, came into the saloon.   I had not seen him for some time ; he looked to me very  gloomy. Without speaking to us, or, perhaps, even seeing  us, he went to the panel, looked at the poulps, and said a few  words to his officer.   The latter went out. Soon the panels were closed. The  ceiling was lighted up again.   I went towards the captain.    A curious collection of poulps, I said in as indifferent  a tone as an amateur might take before the crystal of an  aquarium.    Yes, professor, he replied,  and we are going to fight  them face to face.   I looked at the captain, thinking I had not rightly heard.    Face to face ?  I echoed.    Yes, sir. The screw is stopped. I think that the horny  mandibles of one of them are caught in its branches. That  prevents us moving on.    And what are you going to do ?     Go up to the surface and massacre all that vermin.'    A difficult enterprise.    As you say. The electric bullets are powerless against  their soft flesh, and where they do not find enough resis-  tance to make them go off. But we will attack them with  axes.    And with harpoons, sir, said the Canadian,  if you  do not refuse my aid.    I accept, it, Mr. Land.    We will accompany you, said I, and following Captain  Nemo, we went to the central staircase.     286 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   There about ten men armed with boarding hatchets were  standing ready for the attack. Conseil and I took two  hatchets. Ned Land seized a harpoon.   The Nautilus was then on the surface of the sea. One  of the sailors, placed on the lowest steps, was unscrewing the  bolts of the panel. But he had hardly finished before the  panel was raised with extreme violence, evidently drawn up  by a blowhole in the arm of a poulp.   Immediately one of these long arms glided like a serpent  through the opening, and twenty others were brandished  above it. With a blow of the hatchet Captain Nemo cut  off this formidable tentacle, which glided twisting down the  steps.   At the moment we were crowding together to get up to  the platform, two other arms stretched down to a sailor  placed in front of Captain Nemo, and drew him up with  irresistible violence.   Captain Nemo uttered a cry and rushed out. We followed.   What a scene ! The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle  and fastened to its blowholes, was balanced in the air accord-  ing to the caprice of this enormous trunk. He was chok-  ing, and cried out,  Help 1 help !  in French. The words  caused me a profound stupor. Then I had a countryman  on board, perhaps several I I shall hear that heartrend-  ing cry all my life.   The unfortunate man was lost. Who would rescue him  from that powerful grasp ? Captain Nemo threw himself  on the poulp, and with his hatchet cut off another arm.  His first officer was fighting with rage against other mon-  sters that were climbing the sides of the Nautilus. The crew  were fighting with hatchets.   The Canadian, Conseil, and I dug our arms into the  fleshy masses. A violent smell of musk pervaded the  atmosphere. It was horrible.   For an instant I believed that the unfortunate man, en-  circled by the poulp, would be drawn away from its power-  ful suction. Seven of its eight arms had been cut off, one  only brandishing its victim like a feather twisted about in  the air. But at the very moment that Captain Nemo and his  officer were rushing upon it, the animal hurled out a column     UNDER THE SEA 287   of black liquid, secreted in a bag in its stomach. We were  blinded by it. When this cloud was dissipated the poulp  had disappeared, and with it my unfortunate countryman !   With what rage we then set upon these monsters ! Ten or  twelve poulps had invaded the platform and sides of the  Nautilus. We rolled pell-mell amongst the serpents' trunks  that wriggled about the platform in pools of blood and black  ink. It seemed as if the viscous tentacles kept springing  out again like hydra heads. Ned Land's harpoon at each  stroke plunged into the green eyes of the monster and put  them out. But my brave companion was suddenly thrown  over by one of the tentacles of a monster which he had not  been able to avoid.   Ah, how my heart beat with emotion and horror ! The  poulp's formidable beak opened over Ned Land. The un-  fortunate man was about to be cut in two. I rushed to his  aid. But Captain Nemo was before me. His hatchet dis-  appeared in the two enormous mandibles, and, miracu-  lously preserved, the Canadian rose and plunged the whole  of his harpoon into the poulp's triple heart.    We are quits, said Captain Nemo to the Canadian.   Ned bowed without answering.   This combat had lasted a quarter of an hour. The  monsters, vanquished, mutilated, and death-striken, left the  place clear at last, and disappeared under the waves.   Captain Nemo, covered with blood, stood motionless near  the lantern, and looked at the sea that had swallowed one of  his companions, whilst tears rolled from his eyes.   CHAPTER XIX   THE GULF STREAM   WE none of us can forget that terrible scene of April 2oth.  I wrote it under the impression of violent emotion. Since  then I have revised it and read it to Conseil and the Cana-  dian. They find it exact as to facts, but insufficient as to  effect. To depict such a scene it would take the pen of the  most illustrious of our poets, Victor Hugo.   I said that Captain Nemo wept as he looked at the sea.  His grief was immense. It was the second companion he     288 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   had lost since our arrival on board. And what a death 1  This friend, crushed and stifled by the formidable arm of a  poulp, ground to pieces by its iron mandibles, was not des-  tined to repose with his companions in the peaceful waters of  the coral cemetery.   Amidst the struggle it was the cry of despair uttered by  the unfortunate man that had wrung my heart. The poor  Frenchman, forgetting his conventional language, had  spoken the language of his country and his mother to  utter his last appeal ! Then I had a countryman amongst  the crew of the Nautilus, associated body and soul with  Captain Nemo, avoiding, like him, contact with men !  Was he the only representative of France in this mysterious  association, evidently composed of individuals of different  nationalities ? This was one of the insoluble problems that  ceaselessly came up in my mind.   Captain Nemo went back to his room, and I saw him no  more for some time. But how sad, despairing, and irreso-  lute he was, I judged by the vessel of which he was the soul,  and which was subservent to his will ! The Nautilus no  longer kept any determined direction. It went and came,  floating like a lifeless thing on the waves. Its screw was  free again, but was little used. It went about at random.  But it could not tear itself away from the theatre of its last  struggle from that sea which had devoured one of its  children.   Ten days passed thus. It was not till the ist of May  that the Nautilus frankly took a northerly direction after  sighting the Bahamas at the opening of the Bahama Chan-  nel. We were then following the current of that largest sea  river, which has its own banks, fish, and temperature  the Gulf Stream.   It is, in fact, a river that flows freely in the midst of the  Atlantic, and its waters do not mix with those of the ocean.  It is a salt river salter than the surrounding sea. Its  average depth is three thousand feet, its average breadth  sixty miles. In certain places its current goes along at a  speed of more than'a league an hour. The invariable volume  of its water is more considerable than that of all the rivers  of the globe.     UNDER THE SEA 289   The veritable source of the Gulf Stream, discovered by  Commander Maury, its point of departure, is situated in the  Bay of Biscay. There its waters, still weak in temperature  and colour, begin to form. It goes down south, coasts  equatorial Africa, warms its waters in the rays of the torrid  zone, crosses the Atlantic, reaches Cape San Roque on the  Brazilian coast, and forms two branches, one of which goes  to saturate the seas of the Antilles with its warm particles.  Then the Gulf Stream, whose mission it is to re-establish  equilibrium amongst different temperatures, and to mix the  tropical with the boreal waters, begins its role of gravitation.  Warmed to a white heat in the Gulf of Mexico, it rises north  along the American coasts to Newfoundland, deviates under  the propulsion of the cold current of Davis' Straits, takes  up the ocean route, following one of the great circles of the  globe, the oblique line, divides into two arms about the 43rd  degree, one of which, helped by the trade wind from the  north-east, comes back to the Bay of Biscay and the  Azores, and the other, after having warmed the shores of  Ireland and Norway, goes beyond Spitzbergen, where its  temperature, fallen to four degrees, forms the open sea of the  Pole.   It was upon this river that the Nautilus was then navi-  gating. When it comes out of the Bahama Channel, the  Gulf Stream, then fourteen leagues wide and one hundred  and fifty fathoms deep, goes along at the rate of five miles  an hour. This rapidity gradually diminishes as it ad-  vances northward, and it is to be wished that this regu-  larity should keep up, for it has been remarked that if its  speed and direction were changed, European climates  would be subject to disturbances the consequences of which  could not be calculated.   About noon I was on the platform with Conseil. I was  telling him the different peculiarities of the Gulf Stream.  When my explanation was ended I invited him to plunge  his hands into the stream.   Conseil obeyed, and was much astonished at feeling no  sensation either of heat or cold.    That comes, I said to him,  from the temperature of  the Gulf Stream as it leaves the Gulf of Mexico being little     290 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   different from that of blood. This Gulf Stream is a vast  heating stove that gives eternal verdure to the coasts of  Europe j and, if Maury is to be believed, the heat of this  current, all utilised, would furnish enough to hold in fusion  a river of melted iron as large as the Amazon or the Mis-  souri.   At that moment the speed of the stream was that of five  feet a second. Its current is so distinct from the surround-  ing sea that its compressed waters rise above the level of  the ocean. As it is very rich in saline particles, it is of a  dark blue colour, while the waves that surround it are green.  So distinct is this difference that the Nautilus, abreast of the  Carolinas, cut with its prow the waters of the Gulf Stream,  whilst its screw was still beating those of the ocean.   This current carried down with it a world of living things.  Argonauts, so common in the Mediterranean, travelled in it  in shoals. Amongst the cartilaginous fish the most re-  markable were the rays, of which the very flexible tails  formed nearly a third of the body, and that were like vast  lozenges twenty-five feet long j then dog-fish three feet  long, with large heads, short round snouts, and pointed  teeth in several rows, the bodies of which seemed covered  with scales.   Amongst the bony fish I noticed some grey wrass pecu-  liar to these waters. Giltheads, whose eyes shone like  fire j sawfish, paroquets, veritable rainbows of the ocean  that rival the finest tropical birds in colour j different  specimens of salmon j and a fine fish, the American-knight,  which, decorated with numberless orders and ribbons,  frequents the shores of the great nation where ribbons and  orders are so slightly esteemed.   I may add that during the night the phosphorescent  waters of the Gulf Stream rivalled the electric brilliancy of  our lantern j above all, in the stormy weather which threat-  ened us frequently.   On the 8th of May we were still abreast of Cape Hatteras,  at the height of the North Carolinas. The Gulf Stream is  seventy-five miles wide there, and one hundred and five  fathoms deep. The Nautilus continued to move about at  random. The vessel travelled as though it was without a     UNDER THE SEA 291   man at the helm. I acknowledge that under those circum-  stances an escape might succeed. In fact, the inhabited  shores offered easy refuges on all sides. The sea was  incessantly ploughed by numerous steamers that run be-  tween New York or Boston and the Gulf of Mexico, and  night and day by little schooners that do the coasting  trade on the different points of the American coast. We  might hope to be picked up. It was, therefore, a favourable  opportunity, notwithstanding the thirty miles that separ-  ated the Nautilus from the coasts of the Union.   But one vexatious circumstance thwarted the Canadian's  schemes. The weather was very bad. We were ap-  proaching the regions where tempests are frequent, that  country of gales and cyclones engendered by the current of  the Gulf Stream. To tempt such a sea in a fragile boat  was to court destruction. Ned Land agreed to that himself,  but he was growing more desperate at his continued confine-  ment, and nothing but flight could cure his homesick  feeling.    Sir, said he to me that day,  there must be an end  to this. I want to know how things stand. Your Nemo  is going away from land, up north. But I declare to you  that I have had enough of the South Pole, and I woo't  follow him to the North Pole.    But what is to be done, Ned, as flight is impracticable  just now ?     I return to my first idea. The captain must be spoken  to. You said nothing to him when he was in the seas of  your country. I will speak now that we are in the seas of  mine. When I think that before many days are over the  Nautilus will be abreast of Nova Scotia, and that there,  near Newfoundland, there is a wide bay, that into this bay  the St. Lawrence falls, that the St. Lawrence is my river,  the river of Quebec, my native town j when I think of  that I am furious ; my hair stands on end. I tell you, sir,  I would rather throw myself into the sea 1 I will not stay  here ! I am stifled !    The Canadian had evidently lost all patience. His  vigorous nature could not get accustomed to this pro-  longed imprisonment. His countenance grew daily worse,   u     292 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   his temper more sullen. I could imagine the extent of his  sufferings, for homesickness had seized me too. Nearly  seven months had gone by since we had heard any news  of earth. What is more, Captain Nemo's aloofness, his  altered humour, especially since the fight with the poulps,  his taciturnity, all made me see things in a different light.  I no longer felt the enthusiasm of the first days. One must  be a Dutchman like Conseil to accept the situation in this  sphere reserved for cetaceans and other inhabitants of the  sea. Really if the brave fellow had gills instead of lungs I  think he would make a distinguished fish.    Well, sir ?  perse veringly queried Ned, seeing that I  did not answer.    Well, Ned, you want me to ask Captain Nemo what his  intentions are concerning us ?    ' Yes, sir.   ' Although he has already told them to you ?    ' Yes. I want to be certain about it, once and for all.  Speak for me only if you like.   ' But I rarely meet him. He even avoids me.   ' A greater reason for going to see him.   ' I will ask him, Ned.   ' When ?  asked the Canadian, insisting.   ' When I meet him.   ' M. Aronnax, do you want me to go to him ?    ' No, leave it to me. To-morrow    'To-day, said Ned Land.   ' Very well. I will see him to-day, replied I to the  Canadian, who would have certainly compromised all by  acting on his own account.   I remained alone. Having given Ned the promise, I  resolved to have it carried out immediately. I like things  better done than about to be done.   I entered my room. There I heard some one walking  about in Captain Nemo's. I could not let this occasion of  meeting him slip. I knocked at the door. I obtained no  answer. Knocked again, and then turned the handle. The  door opened,   I entered. The captain was there. Bent over his work-  table, he had heard nothing. Determined to have the     UNDER THE SEA 293   necessary interview. I approached him. He raised his  head suddenly, frowned, and said rather rudely  ' You here ? What do you want ?     To speak to you, captain.    But I am occupied, sir. I am at work. The liberty  I allow you to shut yourself up, may I not enjoy it also ?    My reception was not very encouraging, but I had made  up my mind not to allow the postponement of my mission.    Captain, said I coldly,  I have to speak to you on  business that I cannot put off.    What can that be, sir ?  he replied ironically.  Have  you made some discovery that has escaped me ? Has the  sea given up to you any fresh secret ?    That was far from the subject. Before I could make  an explanation, the captain pointed to a manuscript on the  table, and said in a grave tone    Here is a manuscript written in several languages, M.  Aronnax. It contains the account of my studies on the  sea, and, if God so please, it shall not perish with me. This  manuscript, which will also give the complete history of  my life, and which is signed with my proper name, will  be inclosed in an insubmersible case. The last survivor of  us all on board the Nautilus will throw this case into the  sea, and it will go where the waves will carry it.   The name of this man ! His history written by himself I  Then the mystery that surrounds him will be one day re-  vealed ? But at that moment I only saw in this communi-  cation an opening for me.    Captain, I answered,  I can but approve the idea that  influences you. The fruit of your studies must not be  lost. But the means you employ seem to me very primi-  tive. Who knows where the winds will carry that case, in  what hands it will fall ? Could you not find some better  means ? Could not you or one of yours     Never, sir, said the captain, interrupting me.    But I and my companions will preserve your manu-  script if you will give us liberty     Liberty, sir ?  said Captain Nemo, rising.    Yes, captain, and that is the subject I wished to ask  you about. We have now been seven months on your vessel,     294 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   and I now ask you, in the name of my companions and  myself, if you mean to keep us here always ?     M. Aronnax, said Captain Nemo,  I have only the  same answer to give you that I gave you seven months ago.  Whoever enters my vessel never leaves it again.    But that is slavery !     Call it by what name you please.    But everywhere a slave keeps the right of recovering  his liberty ! Whatever means offer he has the right to  consider them legitimate.    Who has denied you that right ?  answered Captain  Nemo.  Have I ever asked you to bind yourself by an  oath ?    The captain looked at me and folded his arms.    Sir, I said to him,  we shall neither of us care to  return to this subject. But as we have begun it I must go  on. To me study is a help, a powerful diversion, a passion  that can make me forget anything. Like you, I could live  ignored, obscure, in the hope of bequeathing to the future  the result of my work, by means of a case confided to the  mercies of waves and winds. In a word, I can admire you,  follow you with pleasure in a role that I understand, up to a  certain point  but there are other aspects of your life  surrounded with complications and mysteries in which  my companions and I alone have no part. And even when  our hearts could beat for you, moved by your griefs, or  stirred to the bottom by your acts of genius or courage,  we are obliged to repress the least manifestation of sym-  pathy that the ight of what is beautiful and right arouses,  whether it comes rom friend or enemy. It is this feeling of  being strangers to everything that concerns you that makes  our position unbearable, even for me, but much more for  Ned Land. Every man, because he is man, is worth atten-  tion. Have you ever asked yourself what the love of  liberty and hatred of slavery might arouse in a nature like  that of the Canadian, what he might think or attempt    I was silent. Captain Nemo rose.    It does not matter to me what Ned Land thinks or  attempts. I did not take him j I do not keep him on  board my vessel for my own pleasure. As to you, M     UNDER THE SEA 295   Aronnax, you are one of the few people who can understand  anything, even silence. I have nothing more to answer  you. This first time that you come to speak on this subject  must also be the last, for I cannot even listen to you again.   I withdrew. From that day our position was clear. I  related our conversation to my two companions.    We now know, said Ned Land,  that there is nothing  to expect from that man. The Nautilus is approaching  Long Island. We will escape, no matter what the weather  is.   But the sky became more and more threatening. Sym-  toms of a hurricane became manifest. The atmosphere  became white and misty. Fine streaks of tendril-shaped  clouds were gradually being formed into one huge mass.  Other low clouds swept swiftly by. The sea rose in huge  billows. The birds disappeared, with the exception of  petrels, those friends of the storm. The barometer fell  visibly, and indicated an extreme tension of the vapours  in the air. The mixture in the storm-glass was decomposed  under the influence of the electricity which saturated the  atmosphere. The struggle of the elements was approaching.   The tempest broke out on the i8th of May, just as the  Nautilus was floating abreast of Long Island, at some miles  from the port of New York. I can describe this struggle  of the elements, for instead of avoiding it in the depths of  the sea, Captain Nemo, by an inexplicable caprice, pre-  ferred to weather it on the surface.   The wind was blowing from the S.W. at a speed of 45  feet a second, which became 75 before 3 p.m. That is the  figure of tempests.   Captain Nemo, unshaken by the gale, had taken his place  on the platform. He had fastened himself by a rope round  his waist to resist the mountainous waves that swept over  him. I had gone up and fastened myself too, dividing my  admiration between this tempest and the incomparable  man who defied it.   The sea was swept by ragged clouds that dipped into the  billows. I no longer saw any of the intermediary waves  that form in the large hollows nothing but long undula-  tions, the crest of which did not break into foam, so com-     296 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   pact were they. Their height increased. The Nautilus  sometimes lying on its side, sometimes as straight up as a  mast, pitched and tossed frightfully.   About 5 p.m. rain fell in torrents, which neither beat down  wind nor sea. The hurricane blew at the rate of 40 miles  an hour. It is in these conditions that it blows down houses,  blows in tiles and doors, breaks iron gates, and displaces  twenty-four-pound cannon. And yet the Nautilus, amidst  the fury of the elements, justified this saying of a learned  engineer  There is no well-built hull that cannot defy  the sea !  It was not a resisting rock which the waves  would have demolished j it was a steel spindle, obedient  and mobile, without rigging or masts, which could defy  their lash with impunity.   In the meantime I attentively examined these awe-  inspiring billows. They were at least 45 feet high and  250 feet long, and their speed, half that of the wind, was  40 feet a second. Their volume and power increased with  the depth of the water. I then understood the part these  waves play, imprisoning the air and throwing it to the  bottom of the seas, where they carry life with the oxygen.  Their extreme force of pressure, it has been calculated,  can rise to 6,000 Ibs. to each square foot of the surface that  they beat against. They were such waves that in the  Hebrides displaced a block weighing 84,000 Ibs., and in the  tempest of December 23rd, 1864, overthrew a part of the  town of Yeddo, in Japan, going at the rate of 700 kilometres  an hour, and breaking the same day on the shores of  America.   The intensity of the tempest increased with nightfall,  when I saw a large ship pass on the horizon, struggling  painfully. It must have been one of the steamers of the  lines between New York and Liverpool or Havre. It soon  disappeared in the darkness.   At 10 p.m. the sky was all on fire. The atmosphere was  streaked with violent lightning. I could not face its  brilliancy, whilst Captain Nemo, looking straight at it,  seemed the soul of the tempest. A terrible noise filled the  air, made by the waves, wind, and thunder. The wind  veered to all parts of the horizon, and the cyclone, starting     UNDER THE SEA 297   from the east, returned to it, passing north, west, and south  in the opposite directions to the circular tempests of the  austral hemisphere.   Ah ! this Gulf Stream ! Well did it justify its name of  King of the Tempests ! These formidable cyclones were its  creation, caused by the difference of temperature in the  strata of air above its currents.   To the shower of rain succeeded vivid lightning. With  a frightful pitch the 'Nautilus threw up its steel prow into  the air like a lightning-conductor, and I saw it give out  sparks. Completely worn out, I crawled on all-fours to-  wards the panel. I opened it and went down to the saloon.  The tempest had then attained its maximum of intensity.  It was impossible to keep on one's feet in the interior of the  Nautilus.   Captain Nemo came in about midnight. I heard the  reservoirs gradually filling, and the Nautilus slowly sank  under the water.   Through the windows of the saloon I saw large frightened  fish pass like phantoms in the fiery waters. Some were  struck by lightning before my eyes.   The Nautilus still sank. I thought it would find calm  water at a depth of eight fathoms ; but no, the surface was  too violently agitated. We were obliged to sink to twenty-  five fathoms to find rest.   But there, what tranquillity ! what silence ! what a peace-  ful medium ! Who would have said that a terrible tempest  was going on upon the surface of that same ocean ?     CHAPTER XX   THE FIRST CABLE   THE storm had thrown us eastward once more. All hope  of escaping on the shores of New York or the St. Lawrence  had vanished. Poor Ned, in despair, shut himself up like  Captain Nemo. Conseil and I left each other no more.  I ought rather to have given N.E. as the direction of the  Nautilus, to be more exact. For some days it drifted about,     298 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   sometimes on the surface, sometimes beneath it, amid those  fogs so dreaded by sailors. What accidents are due to thick  fogs ! What shocks upon the reefs when the noise of the  wind is louder than the breaking of the waves ! What  collisions between vessels, notwithstanding the fog-signals  and alarm-bells !   The bottom of these seas looked like a battle-field where  still lay all the ocean's victims some already old and in-  crusted, some yellow and reflecting the light of our lantern  on their iron and copper hulls. Amongst them lay many  vessels lost with all hands crews and emigrants on the  dangerous points signalled in their statistics, Cape Race,  Saint Paul Island, Strait of Belle Isle, the estuary of the  St. Lawrence. Many victims have been added to the  gloomy list within several years only from the lines of the  Royal Mail, Inman, and Montreal. The Solway, Isis,  Paramatta, Hungarian, Canadian, Anglo-Saxon, Humboldt,  United States, all sunk. The Arctic, Lyonnaise, sunk by  collision. The President, Pacific, City of '.Glasgow, disap-  peared from unknown causes. The Nautilus went on amidst  these gloomy remains as if passing the dead in review.   On the i5th of May we were at the southern extremity of  Newfoundland Bank. This bank is formed of alluvia, or  large heaps of organic matter, brought either from the  equator by the Gulf Stream or from the North Pole by the  counter-current of cold water that skirts the American  coast. There also are piled those erratic blocks of stone  carried down by the breaking up of the ice. And it is also  a vast charnel-house of molluscs and zoophytes, which perish  there by millions.   The depth of the sea is not great on Newfoundland Bank  a few hundred fathoms at most. But towards the south is  a depression of 1,500 fathoms. There the Gulf Stream  widens. It loses speed and heat and becomes a sea.   It was upon this inexhaustible Newfoundland Bank  that I surprised cod in its favourite waters.   It may be said that cod are mountain-fish, for Newfound-  land is only a submarine mountain. As the Nautilus  moved through the thick shoals of them Conseil said    Those cod ! I thought cod were as flat as soles.     UNDER THE SEA 299    They are only flat at the grocer's, said I,  where they  are open and dried. But in water they are like mullet,  and shaped for speed.    What a lot of them !  said Conseil.    There would be more but for their enemies sharks  and men ! Do you know how many eggs there are in a  single female ?     I'll guess well, answered Conseil j  five hundred thou-  sand !     Eleven millions, my friend.    Eleven millions 1 I will never believe that till I count  them myself.    Count them, Conseil, but it will be quicker work to  believe me. Besides, the French, English, Americans,  Danes, and Norwegians catch cod by thousands. A prodi-  gious quantity of them is consumed, and if they were not  so astonishingly fertile the seas would soon be cleared of  them. In England and America only, 5,000 ships, manned  by 75,000 sailors, are employed in the cod fisheries. Each  ship brings in an average of 40,000, which makes 25,000,000.  On the coasts of Norway the same result.    I have confidence in monsieur, said Conseil j  I will  not count them.    Count what ?     The eleven millions of eggs. But I must make one  remark.    What ?     Why, if all the eggs bore, four cods would be enough to  feed England, America, and Norway.    Whilst we were on Newfoundland Bank I saw the long  lines, armed with two hundred hooks, which each boat  hangs out by dozens. Each line had a little grappling-  iron at one end, and was fastened to the surface by a buoy-  rope, the buoy being made of cork. The Nautilus had  to be skilfully steered amidst this submarine network.   However, it did not stay long in these frequented regions.  It went northwards to the 42nd degree of latitude. It was  abreast of Saint John's, in Newfoundland, and Heart's  Content.   The Nautilus, instead of keeping to its course northward,     300 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   took an easterly direction as if to follow the telegraphic  plateau on which the cable lies, and of which the multiplied  soundings have given the exact plan.   It was on the iyth of May, at about 500 miles from Heart's  Content, and at a depth of 1,400 fathoms, that I saw the  cable lying on the ground. Conseil, whom I had not told  about it, took it for a gigantic serpent, and prepared to  classify it according to his usual method. But I consoled  the worthy fellow, and by way of assurance told him various  particulars about the laying down of the cable.   The first cable was laid during the years 1857 and 1858 j  but, after having transmitted about four hundred telegrams,  it ceased to act. In 1863 the engineers manufactured a new  cable, measuring 2,000 miles in length and weighing 4,500  tons, which was embarked on board the Grea Eastern.  This attempt also failed.   Now on the 25th of May the Nautilus, at a depth of 190  fathoms, was in the exact place where the rupture occurred  that ruined the enterprise. It was at 638 miles from the  Irish coast. It was perceived at 2 p.m. that communication  with Europe was interrupted. The electricians on board  resolved to cut the cable in order to haul it up again, and  at ii p.m. they had brought in the damaged part. They  made a joint, and spliced it, and it was once more sub-  merged. But a few days later it broke, and could not be  found again in the depths of the ocean.   The Americans were not discouraged. The daring Cyrus  Field, the promoter of the enterprise, who had risked all his  fortune in it, raised a fresh subscription. It was immedi-  ately taken up. Another cable was laid under better  conditions. The conducting-wires were enveloped in gutta-  percha and protected by a wadding of hemp contained in  metal armour. The Great Eastern set out with it again on  the I3th of July, 1866.   The operation went on well. However, one hitch oc-  curred. Several times, whilst unrolling the cable, the  electricians observed that nails had recently been driven into  it in order to spoil the wire. Captain Anderson, his officers  and engineers, met, deliberated, and caused it to be adver-  tised that, if the culprit were caught on board, he should     UNDER THE SEA 301   be thrown into the sea without further judgment. After  that the criminal attempt was not repeated.   On the 23rd of July the Great Eastern was not more than  five hundred miles from Newfoundland when the news of  the armistice between Prussia and Austria, after Sadowa,  was telegraphed to it. On the 27th it sighted, through the  fog, the port of Heart's Content. The enterprise was  happily terminated, and in the first despatch young America  telegraphed to old Europe these wise words, so rarely  understood :  Glory to God in the highest, and on earth  peace, goodwill towards men.   I did not expect to find the electric cable in its original  state as it came from the manufactories. It looked like a  serpent and was so thickly covered with shells, that it was  protected against perforating molluscs. It was lying un-  disturbed, sheltered from the movements of the sea, and  under a pressure favourable to the transmission of the  electric spark, which passes from America to Europe in  32 of a second. The duration of this cable will, doubtless,  be infinite, for it has been remarked that its gutta-percha  envelope is improved by the sea-water.   Besides, on this plateau, so happily chosen, the cable is  never submerged at such depths as to cause it to break.  The Nautilus followed it to its greatest depth, in about  2,200 fathoms, and there it lay without any effort of traction.  Then we approached the place where the accident took  place in 1863.   The bottom of the sea there formed a wide valley on  which Mont Blanc might rest without its summit emerging  above the waves. This valley is closed on the east by a  precipitous wall 6,000 feet high. We reached it on the  28th of May, when the Nautilus was not more than 120  miles from Ireland.   Was Captain Nemo going north to coast the British  Isles ? No. To my great surprise he went southward  again and returned to European seas. Whilst rounding  the Emerald Isle I caught a glimpse of Cape Clear and  Fastnet Beacon, which lights the thousands of vessels from  Glasgow to Liverpool.   An important question then occurred to me. Would     302 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   the Nautilus dare to enter the English Channel ? Ned  Land, who had reappeared since we were near land, ques-  tioned me constantly. How could I answer him ? Cap-  tain Nemo remained invisible. After having allowed the  Canadian a glimpse of the American shores, was he going  to show me those of France ?   The Nautilus still went southward. On the 30th of  May we sighted Land's End, between the extreme point of  England and the Scilly Isles, which were left to starboard.   If the vessel was going to enter the Channel it must go  direct east. It did not do so.   During the whole of the 3ist of May the Nautilus de-  scribed a series of circles on the water that greatly interested  me. It seemed to be seeking a spot there was some difficulty  in finding. At noon Captain Nemo came to take the bear-  ings himself. He did not speak to me, and seemed gloomier  than ever. What could sadden him thus ? Was it his  proximity to European shores ? Was it some memory of  the country he had abandoned ? What was it he felt,  remorse or regret ? For a long time this thought haunted  my mind, and I felt a kind of presentiment that before long  chance would reveal the captain's secrets.   The next day, the ist of June, the Nautilus continued  the same manoeuvres. It was evidently trying to find a  precise point in the ocean. Captain Nemo came to take  the sun's altitude like he did the day before. The sea was  calm, the sky pure. Eight miles to the east a large steam-  ship appeared on the horizon. No flag fluttered from its  mast, and I could not find out its nationality.   Some minutes before the sun passed the meridian Cap-  tain Nemo took his sextant and made his observation with  extreme precision. The absolute calm of the waters facili-  tated the operation. The motionless Nautilus neither  pitched nor rolled.   At that moment I was upon the platform. When the cap-  tain had taken his observation he pronounced these words:    It is here !    He went down through the panel. Had he seen the  ship that had tacked about, and seemed to be bearing down  upon us ? I cannot tell.     UNDER THE SEA 303   I returned to the saloon. The panel was shut, and I  heard the water hissing into the reservoirs. The Nautilus  began to sink vertically, its screw was stopped, and com-  municated no movement to it.   A few minutes later it stopped at a depth of 418 fathoms,  and rested on the ground.   The luminous ceiling of the saloon was then extinguished,  the panels were opened, and through the windows I saw  the sea lighted up within a radius of half-a-mile by our  electric lantern.   I looked through the larboard window and saw nothing  but an expanse of tranquil water.   On the starboard appeared a large protuberance which  attracted my attention. It looked like a ruin buried under  a crust of white shells like a mantle of snow. Whilst  attentively examining this mass I thought I recognised the  swollen outlines of a ship, cleared of her masts, that must  have gone down prow foremost. The disaster must have  taken place at a distant epoch. This wreck, incrusted with  lime, had been lying many years at the bottom of the ocean.   What was this ship ? Why did the Nautilus come to  visit its tomb ? Was it only a wreck that had drawn the  Nautilus under water ?   I did not know what to think, when, near me, I heard  Captain Nemo say in a slow voice    Once that ship was called the Marseillais. It carried  seventy-four guns, and was launched in 1762. In 1778,  on the I3th of August, commanded by La Polype- Vertrieux  it fought daringly against the Preston. In 1779, on the  4th of July, it assisted the squadron of the Admiral d'Es-  taing to take Granada. In 1781, on the 5th of Septem-  ber, it took part in the naval battle of Chesapeake Bay.  In 1794 the French Republic changed its name. On the  i6th of April of the same year it joined at Brest the squad-  ron of Villaret-Joyeuse as escort to a cargo of wheat  coming from America under the command of Admiral Van  Stabel. On the nth and I2th prairial, year II., this  squadron encountered the English vessels. Sir, to-day  is the isth prairial, the ist of June, 1868. It is 74 years  ago to-day, that in this same place, this ship, after an heroic     304 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   fight, dismasted, the water in her hold, the third of her  crew disabled, preferred to sink with her 356 sailors than  to surrender, and, nailing her colours to her stern, disap-  peared under the waves to the cry of ' Vive la Republique !   (Carlyle says  This enormous inspiring feat turns out  to be an enormous inspiring nonentity, extant nowhere  save as falsehood in the brain of Barrere 1 )    The Vengeur I  I exclaimed.    Yes, sir. The Vengeur ! A glorious name 1  mur-  mured the captain as he folded his arms.   CHAPTER XXI   A HECATOMB   THE unexpectedness of this scene and the way it was  spoken of, the account of the patriotic ship, given coldly  at first, and then the emotion with which the strange  person had uttered his last words, this name of Vengeur,  the signification of which could not escape me, all struck  my imagination profoundly. My eyes no longer left the  captain. He, with hands stretched out to the sea, was  looking with ardent eyes at the silent wreck. Perhaps I  never was to know who he was, from whence he came,  whither he was going, but I saw the man separate himself,  more and more from the world of science. It was not a  vulgar misanthropy that had inclosed Captain Nemo and  his companions in the sides of the Nautilus, but a monstrous  or sublime hatred that time could not exhaust.   Did this hatred still seek vengeance ? The future was  soon to tell me that.   In the meantime the Nautilus was slowly ascending to  the surface of the sea, and I saw the confused outlines of the  Vengeur gradually disappear. Soon a slight pitching told  me we were floating in the open air.   At that moment a dull detonation was heard. I looked  at the captain, but he did not stir.    Captain ?  I said.   He did not answer.   I left him and went up on to the plaftorm. Conseil and  the Canadian had preceded me there,     UNDER THE SEA 305    What was that noise ?  I asked.    A gunshot, answered Ned Land.   I looked in the direction of the ship I had perceived  before. She had neared the Nautilus, and was putting on  more steam. Six miles separated us from her.    What vessel is that, Ned ?     By her rigging and the height of her low masts,  answered the Canadian,  I bet she's a war-ship. I hope  she'll come and sink us, if necessary, along with this con-  founded Nautilus.    What harm can she do the Nautilus, friend Ned ?   said Conseil.  Can she attack it under the waves ? Will  she cannonade it at the bottom of the sea ?     Can you tell me her nationality, friend Ned ?  I asked.   The Canadian knit his brow, screwed up his eyes, and  fixed the whole power of his eyes on to the ship.    No, sir, he answered.  I cannot find out to what  nation she belongs. Her colours are not hoisted. But  I can affirm that she is a ship-of-war, for a long pendant  is floating from her mainmast.   For a quarter of an hour we went on looking at the ship  that was bearing down upon us. Still I did not think she  had sighted the Nautilus at that distance, still less did she  know what it was.   The Canadian soon announced that this vessel was a  large warship, a two-decker, and an ironclad with a ram.   Thick black smoke was issuing from her two funnels. Her  reefed sails could not be distinguished from her yards. She  bore no colours. Distance prevented us making out the col-  our of her pendant, which streamed like a'narrow ribbon.   She was rapidly approaching. If Captain Nemo allowed  her to come near it would offer us a chance of escape.    Sir, said Ned Land to me,  if that ship passes within  a mile of us I shall throw myself into the sea, and I advise  you to do the same.   I did not answer the Canadian's proposition, and went on  looking at the ship, which grew gradually larger. Whether  she were English, French, American, or Russian, she would  certainly take us in if we could reach her.   '' Monsieur will please to remember that we have had     3o6 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   some experience in swimming. He can leave me the  care of towing him towards the ship if it suits him to follow  Ned, said Conseil.   I was going to answer when some white smoke issued from  the prow of the vessel. Then, a few seconds afterwards,  the water aft of the Nautilus was thrown up by the fall of  some heavy body. In a short time we heard the report.    Why, they are firing at us !  I exclaimed.    Good people !  muttered the Canadian.  Then they  do not take us for shipwrecked men on a raft !     If monsieur will allow me to say so, that's right, said  Conseil, shaking off the water that another shot had  sprinkled him with.  If monsieur will allow me to say so,  they have sighted the monster whale, and are firing at it.    But they must see that they have men to deal with !  I  exclaimed.    Perhaps that is the reason, answered Ned Land, look-  ing at me.   Quite a revelation was made in my mind. They doubtless  knew now what to think about the existence of the supposed  monster. Doubtless Captain Farragut had found out that  the Nautilus was a submarine boat, and more dangerous  than a supernatural monster when it struck against the  Abraham Lincoln.   Yes, it must be so, and they were doubtless pursuing the  terrible engine of destruction in every sea.   Terrible if, as might be supposed, Captain Nemo was  employing the Nautilus in a work of vengeance. During  that night when he had imprisoned us in the cell, in the  Indian Ocean, had he not attacked some ship ? The man  now interred in the coral cemetery, was he not a victim of  the shock provoked by the Nautilus ? Yes, I repeat, it  must be so. A part of the mysterious existence of Captain  Nemo was revealed. And if his identity was not found out,  at least nations were in arms against him, chasing now no  chimerical being, but a man who had vowed them implac-  able hatred 1   All the formidable past appeared before my eyes. In-  stead of meeting with friends on the ship that was approach-  ing, we should only find oitiless enemies.     UNDER THE SEA 307   In the meantime cannon-balls were whizzing about us.  Some, meeting the liquid surface, ricochetted to consider-  able distances. But none reached the Nautilus.   The ironclad was then not more than three miles off.  Notwithstanding the violent cannonade, Captain Nemo  did not make his appearance on the platform. And yet  if one of these cannon balls had struck the hull of the  Nautilus in a mormal line it would have been disastrous  to it   The Canadian then said to me    Sir, we ought to attempt anything to get out of this.  Let us make signals ! A thousands devils ! They will  perhaps understand that we are honest men !    Ned Land took out his handkerchief to wave it in the  air. But he had hardly spread it out than, floored by a  grasp of iron, notwithstanding his prodigious strength, he  fell on the platform.    Wretch !  cried the captain.  Do you want me to nail  you to the ram of the Nautilus before it rushes against that  ship ?    Captain Nemo, terrible to hear, was still more terrible to  behold. His face had grown pale under the spasms of his  heart, which must for an instant have ceased to beat. The  pupils of his eyes were fearfully contracted. His voice  no longer spoke, it roared. With body bent forward, he  shook the Canadian by the shoulders.   Then leaving him, and turning to the ironclad, whose  shots rained round him, he said    Ah ! you know who I am, ship of a cursed nation !   cried he in a powerful voice.  I do not need to see your  colours to recognise you ! Look, I will show you mine !    And Captain Nemo spread out a black flag along the  platform like the one he had planted at the South Pole.   At that moment a projectile struck the hull of the  Nautilus obliquely, and, ricochetting near the captain, fell  into the sea.   Captain Nemo shrugged his shoulders. Then, speaking to  me    Go down, he said in a curt tone  go down, you and  your companions.     308 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES    Sir, I cried,  are you going to attack that ship ?     Sir, I am going to sink it !     You wiU not do that.    I shall do it !  replied Captain Nemo.  Do not take  upon yourself to judge me, sir. Fate has shown you what  you were not to see. The attack has been made. The  repulse will be terrible. Go down below.    What is that ship ?     You do not know ? Well, so much the better 1 Its  nationality, at least, will remain unknown to you. Go  below.   The Canadian, Conseil, and I were obliged to obey.  About fifteen of the Nautihts's crew had surrounded the  captain, and were looking with an implacable feeling of  hatred at the ship that was advancing towards them. It  was evident that the same feeling of vengeance animated  them all.   I went down as another projectile struck the Nautilus, and  I heard its captain exclaim    Strike, mad vessel ! Shower your useless shot ! You  will not escape the ram of the Nautilus ! But this is not  the place you are to perish in ! Your ruins shall not mix  with those of the Vengeur !    I went to my room. The captain and his officer re-  mained on the platform. The screw was put in movement.  The Nautilus speedily put itself out of range of the ship.  But the pursuit went on, and Captain Nemo contented  himself with keeping his distance.   About 4 p.m. I became unbearably impatient and  returned to the central staircase. The panel was opened.  I ventured on to the platform. The captain was walking  along it with an agitated air. He was looking at the vessel  which was lying five or six miles to leeward. Perhaps he  hesitated to attack her.   I wished to intervene once again. But I had hardly  spoken to Captain Nemo when he imposed silence on me,  saying    I represent right and justice here I I am the oppressed,  and there is the oppressor ! It is through it that all I  loved, cherished, and venerated country, wife, children,     UNDER THE SEA 309   father and mother all perished ! All that I hate is there J  Be silent !    I looked for the last time at the ironclad, which was  putting on more steam. Then I went back to Ned and  Conseil.    We must fly !  I cried.    Well, said Ned,  what ship is it ?     I do not know. But whatever it is it will be sunk  before night. In any case it is better to perish also than  to be the accomplices of an act, the justice of which we  cannot judge.    I think so too, answered Ned coldly.  We must  wait till night.   Night came. Profound silence reigned on board. The  compass indicated that the Nautilus had not changed its  direction. I heard its screw beating the waves with rapid  regularity. It kept on the surface of the water, and a slight  rolling sent it from side to side.   My companions and I had resolved to make a dash from  the Nautilus as soon as those on the battleship had ap-  proached near enough to hear or see us. Once on board  the ship, if we could not prevent the blow that threatened her,  we could at least do our utmost to prevent a catastrophe. I  thought several times that the Nautilus was preparing for  the attack. But it contented itself with allowing its  adversary to approach, and a short time afterwards fled  away again.   A part of the night passed without incident. We were  awaiting an opportunity to act. We spoke little, being  too much excited. Ned Land wanted to throw himself into  the sea. I made him wait. I thought the Nautilus would  attack the two-decker on the surface of the sea, and then  it would not only be possible but easy to escape.   At 3 a.m., being as uneasy as ever, I went up on to the  platform. Captain Nemo had notleft it. He was standing,  near his flag, which a slight breeze was waving over his head.  He did not lose sight of his antagonist. His look of extra-  ordinary intensity, seemed to attract her, fascinate her, and  draw her onward more surely than if he had been towing  her.     3io TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   The moon was then passing the meridian. Jupiter was  rising in the east. Sky and ocean were equally tranquil,  and the sea offered to the Queen of Night the clearest  mirror that had ever reflected her image.   And when I compared the profound calm of the elements  with the anger that was smouldering in the Nautilus I felt  myself shudder all over.   The ship kept at two miles' distance from us. She kept  approaching the phosphorescent light that indicated the  presence of the Nautilus. I could see her green and red  lights and white lantern hung from her mainstay. An  indistinct reflection lighted up her rigging and showed that  the fires were heated to the uttermost. Sparks and flames  were escaping from her funnels and starring the atmosphere.   I remained thus till 6 a.m. without Captain Nemo appear-  ing to notice me. The vessel was a mile and a half off, and  with the break of day her cannonade began again. The  moment could not be distant when, the Nautilus attacking  its adversary, my companions and I would for ever leave  this man whom I dared not judge.   I was about to go down to tell them about it when the  officer came up on the platform. Several sailors accom-  panied him. Captain Nemo either did not or would not  see them. Certain precautions were taken, which might be  called the clearing up for the fight. They were very  simple. The iron balustrade was lowered. The lantern  and pilot-cages were sunk into the hull until they were on a  level with the deck. The surface of the long steel-plated  cigar no longer offered a single salient point that could  hinder its manoeuvres.   I returned to the saloon. The Nautilus was still above the  water. Some morning beams were filtering through their  liquid bed. Under certain undulations of the waves the  windows were lighted up with the red beams of the rising  sun. The dreadful 2nd of June had dawned.   At 5 a.m. the log showed me that the speed of the  Nautilus was slackening. I understood that it was letting  the ship approach. Besides, the firing was more distinctly  heard, and the projectiles, ploughing up the surrounding  water, disappeared with a strange hissing noise.     UNDER THE SEA 311    My friends, said I,  the time is come. One grasp of  the hand, and may God help us !    Ned Land was resolute, Conseil calm, I nervous, scarcely  able to contain myself.   We all passed into the library. As I was opening the  door that led on to the cage of the central staircase I heard  the upper panel shut with a bang.   The Canadian sprang up the steps, but I stopped him.  A well-known hissing sound told me that they were letting  water into the reservoirs. In a few minutes' time the  Nautilus sank a few yards below the surface of the sea.   I now understood its manoeuvre. It was too late to do  anything. The Nautilus did not think of striking the two-  decker in her impenetrable armour, but below her water-  line, where she was unprotected by plates of steel.   We were again imprisoned, unwilling witnesses of the  tragic event that was in store. We had hardly time to  reflect. Taking refuge in my room, we looked at each  other without speaking a word. A profound stupor took  possession of my mind. My thoughts seemed to be para-  lysed. I was in that painful state of expectation that  precedes a dreadful crash. I waited and listened.   In the meantime the speed of the Nautilus visibly in-  creased. It was taking a spring. All its hull vibrated.   Suddenly I uttered a cry. A shock had taken place, but a  relatively slight one. I felt the penetrating force of the  steel ram. I heard a grating, scraping sound. But the  Nautilus, carried along by its force of propulsion, passed  through the mass of the ship like a needle through cloth.   I could stand it no longer. I rushed like a madman into  the saloon.   Captain Nemo was there. Mute, sombre, implacable, he  was looking through the port panel.   An enormous mass was sinking through the water, and,  in order to lose nothing of its agony, the Nautilus was  sinking with it. At thirty feet from me I saw the broken  hull, into which the water was rushing with a noise like  thunder, then the double line of guns and bulwarks. The  deck was covered with black moving shades.   The water rose. The unfortunate creatures were crowd-     312 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   ing in the ratlines, clinging to the masts, struggling in the  water. It was a human ant-hill being swallowed by the  sea !   Paralysed, stiffened with anguish, my hair standing on  end, eyes wide open, panting, breathless, voiceless, I looked  on the scene. An irresistible attraction glued me to the  window.   The enormous ship sank slowly. The Nautilus, follow-  ing her, watched all her movements. All at once an  explosion took place. The compressed air blew up the  decks of the ship as though her magazines had been fired.  The water was so much disturbed that the Nautilus swerved.   Then the unfortunate ship sank more rapidly. Her  tops, loaded with victims, appeared ; then her spars,  bending under the weight of men ; then the summit of her  mainmast. Then the dark mass disappeared, and with it  the crew, drawn down by a formidable eddy.   I turned to Captain Nemo. That terrible avenger, a  perfect archangel of hatred, was still looking. When all  was over he went to the door of his room, opened it, and  went in. I followed him with my eyes.   On the end panel, below his heroes, I saw the portrait of a  woman still young, and two little children. Captain Nemo  looked at them for a few moments, held out his arms to  them, and, kneeling down, burst into sobs.     CHAPTER XXII   CAPTAIN NEMO'S LAST WORDS   THE panels were closed on this frightful act, but light  had not been restored to the saloon. In the interior of  the Nautilus reigned darkness and silence. It was leaving  this place of desolation, a hundred feet under the water, at  a prodigious speed. Where was it going north or south ?  Where was the man flying to after this horrible slaughter ?   I went back to my room, where Ned and Conseil had  silently stopped. I felt an insurmountable horror of  Captain Nemo. Whatever he may have suffered he had no     UNDER THE SEA 313   right to punish thus. He had made me, if not his accom-  plice, at least the witness of his vengeance ! That was too  much !   At eleven o'clock the electric light reappeared. I went  into the saloon and consulted the different instruments.  The Nautilus was flying north at a speed of twenty-five  miles an hour, sometimes on the surface of the sea, some-  times thirty feet below it.   By taking our bearings on the chart I saw that we were  passing the entrance to the English Channel, and that we  were going to the North seas at a frightful speed.   I could hardly see in thsir rapid passage the long-nosed  dog-fish, hammer-fish, and rougettes that frequent these  waters ; large sea-eagles, eels twisting about like fiery  serpents, armies of crabs flying obliquely, folding their  claws across their shells ; lastly, shoals of herrings rivalling  the Nautilus in speed. But there was no question of  observing, studying, and classifying them.   In the evening we had traversed two hundred leagues of  the Atlantic. Night came, and the sea was dark till the  moon rose.   I went to my room, but could not sleep. I was assailed by  nightmare. The horrible scene of destruction was repeated  in my mind.   From that day who could tell where the Nautilus took  us in this North Altantic basin ? Always with terrific  speed. Always amidst the cold, northern mists. Did it  touch at Spitzbergen or the shores of Nova Zembla ?  Did we explore the unknown White Sea, Kara Sea, Gulf of  Obi, Archipelago of Liarrov, and the unknown coast of  Asia ? I cannot tell. I do not even know how the time  went. The clocks on board had stopped. It seemed  as if night and day, as in polar countries, no longer followed  their regular course. I felt myself carried into that region  of the strange where the overridden imagination of Edgar  Poe roamed at will. At each instant I expected to see, like  the fabulous Gordon Pym,  that veiled human face, of  much larger proportions than that of any inhabitant of the  earth, thrown across the cataract that defends the approach  to the Pole ?     314 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   I estimate but perhaps I am mistaken that this adven  turous course of the Nautilus lasted fifteen or twenty days,  and I do not know how long it would have lasted but for the  catastrophe that ended this voyage. Captain Nemo never  appeared, nor his officer. Not a man of the crew was  visible for an instant. The Nautilus kept below the water  almost incessantly. When it went up to the surface to renew  the air, the panels opened and shut mechanically. The  bearings were no longer reported on the chart. I did not  know where we were.   I must say also that the Canadian, out of all patience, did  not appear either. Conseil could not get a word out of  him, and feared that in a temporary fit of insanity or  under the influence of extreme homesickness, he might  kill himself. He watched over him, therefore, with  constant devotion.   It will be understood that under such circumstances the  situation was no longer bearable.   One morning I do not know its date I had fallen into  a restless sleep at early dawn. When I woke I saw Ned  Land bending over me, and heard him whisper    We are going to fly 1    I sat up.    When ?  I asked.    To-night. All supervision seems to have disappeared  from the Nautilus. Stupor seems to reign on board.  Shall you be ready, sir ?     Yes. Where are we ?     In sight of land that I have just sighted through the  mist, twenty miles to the east.    What land is it ?     I do not know, but whatever it is we will seek refuge on  it.    Yes ! Ned yes, we will go to-night, even should the  sea swallow us up !     The sea is rough, the wind violent, but twenty miles in  that light boat of the Nautilus do not frighten me. I have  put some provisions and a few bottles of water in it without  the knowledge of the crew.    I will follow you.     UNDER THE SEA 35    Besides, added the Canadian,  if I am caught, I shall  defend myself and get killed.    We will die together, friend Ned.   I had made up my mind to anything. The Canadian  left me. I ascended to the platform, where I could scarcely  stand against the waves. The sky was threatening, but  as land lay hidden just behind thick mists, we must fly.  We must not lose a day nor an hour.   I went down to the saloon both fearing and wishing to  meet Captain Nemo, both wanting and not wanting to see  him. What could I say to him ? Could I hide from him  the involuntary horror he inspired me with ? No 1 It was  better not to find myself face to face with him I Better to  forget him ! And yet   What a long day was the last I had to pass on board the  Nautilus \ I remained alone. Ned Land and Conseil  avoided me, so as not to betray us by talking.   At 6 p.m. I dined, but without appetite. I forced  myself to eat notwithstanding my lost appetite, wishing to  keep up my strength.   At half-past six Ned Land entered my room. He said  to me    We shall not see each other again before our departure.  At ten o'clock the moon will not yet be up. We shall take  advantage of the darkness. Come to the boat. Conseil  and I will be waiting for you there.   Then the Canadian went out without giving me time to  answer.   I wished to verify the direction of the Nautilus. I went  to the saloon. We were going N.N.E. with frightful speed  at a depth of twenty-five fathoms.   I looked for the last time at all the natural marvels and  riches of art collected in this museum, in this unrivalled  collection destined one day to perish in the depths of the sea  with the man who had made it. I wished to take a lasting  impression of it in my mind. I remained thus for an hour,  bathed in the light of the luminous ceiling, and passing in  review the shining treasures in their glass cases. Then I  went back to my room.   There I put on my solid sea-garments. I collected my     316 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   notes together and placed them carefully about me. My  heart beat loudly. I could not check its pulsations.  Certainly my agitation would have betrayed me to Captain  Nemo.   What was he doing at that moment ? I listened at the  door of his room. I heard the sound of footsteps : Captain  Nemo was there. He had not gone to bed. At every  movement that he made I thought he was going to appear  and ask me why I wanted to escape ! I was constantly  on the alert. My imagination exaggerated everything.  This impression became so poignant that I asked myself if I  had not better enter the captain's room, see him face to  face, dare him with look and gesture !   It was a madman's inspiration. I fortunately restrained  myself, and lay down on my bed to stay the agitation of my  body and mind. My nerves gradually grew calmer, but  in my excited brain I passed in review my whole existence  on board the Nautilus, all the happy or unfortunate incidents  that had occurred since my disappearance from iheAbraham  Lincoln, the submarine hunts, Torres Straits, the Papuan  savages, the stranding, the coral cemetery, the Suez tunnel,  Santorin Island, the Cretan plunger, Vigo Bay, Atlantis,  the ice-bank, the South Pole, the imprisonment in ice, the  fight with the poulps, the tempest of the Gulf Stream,  the Vengeur, and that horrible scene of the sunken ship and  her crew ! All these events passed through my mind like  the background to a scene at the theatre. Then Captain  Nemo grew out of all proportion as the central figure. He  was no longer a man like me, but the genius of the sea.  It w'as then half-past nine. I held my head in my hands  to prevent it bursting. I closed my eyes, and was deter-  mined to think jno more. Another half-hour to wait.  Another half-hour's nightmare would drive me mad !   At that moment I heard the vague chords of the organ, a  sad harmony under an indefinable melody, veritable wails  of a soul that wished to break all terrestrial ties. I listened  with all my senses, hardly breathing, plunged, like Captain  Nemo, in one of those musical ecstasies which took him  beyond the limits of this world.   Then a sudden thought terrified me. Captain Nemo had     UNDER THE SEA 317   left his room. He was in the saloon that I was obliged to  cross in my flight. There I should meet him for the last  time. He would see me, perhaps speak to me. A gesture  from him could paralyse me, a single word could chain me  to his vessel.   Ten o'clock was on the point of striking. The moment  had come to leave my room and rejoin my companions.   I could not hesitate should Captain Nemo stand before  me. I opened my door with precaution, and yet it seemed  to make a fearful noise. Perhaps that noise only existed in  my imagination.   I felt my way along the dark waist of the Nautilus,  stopping at every step to suppress the beatings of my heart.   I reached the corner door of the saloon and opened it  softly. The saloon was quite dark. The tones of the  organ were feebly sounding. Captain Nemo was there.  He did not see me. I think that in a full light he would  not have perceived me, he was so absorbed.   I dragged myself over the carpet, avoiding the least con-  tact, lest the noise should betray my presence. It took  me five minutes to reach the door into the library.   I was going to open it when a sigh from Captain Nemo  nailed me to the place. I thought that he had moved from  his seat. I even saw him, for some rays from the lighted  library reached the saloon. He came towards me with  folded arms, silent, gliding rather than walking, like a  ghost. His oppressed chest heaved with sobs, and I heard  him murmur these words the last I heard :    Almighty God ! Enough ! Enough !    Was it remorse that was escaping thus from the con-  science of that man ?   Desperate, I rushed into the library, went up the central  staircase, and, following the upper waist, reached the  boat through the opening that had already given passage to  my two companions.    Let us go ! Let us go !  I cried.    At once, answered the Canadian.   The orifice in the plates of the Nautilus was first shut and  bolted by means of a wrench that Ned Land had provided  himself with. The opening in the boat was also closed, and     318 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES   the Canadian began to take out the screws that still fastened  us to the submarine vessel.   Suddenly a noise was heard in the interior. Voices  answered one another quickly. What was the matter ?  Had they discovered our flight ? I felt Ned Land glide  a dagger into my hand.    Yes !  I murmured,  we shall know how to die !    The Canadian had stopped in his work. But one word,  twenty times repeated, a terrible word, revealed to me the  cause of the agitation on board the Nautilus. The crew  were not anxious about us.    The Maelstrom ! the Maelstrom 1  they were crying.   The Maelstrom ! Could a more frightful word in a  more frightful situation have sounded in our ears ? Were  we then on the most dangerous part of the Norwegian  shore ? Was the Nautilus being dragged into a gulf at the  very moment our boat was preparing to leave its side ?   It is well known that at the tide the pent-up waters be-  tween the Feroe and Loffoden Islands rush out with  irresistible violence. They form a whirlpool from which  no ship could ever escape. From every point of the  horizon rush monstrous and irresistible waves. They  form the gulf justly called  Navel of the Ocean, of which  the power of attraction extends for a distance of ten miles.  There not only vessels but whales are sucked up.   It was there that the Nautilus had been purposely, or by  mistake run by its captain. It was describing a spiral, the  circumference of which was lessening by degrees. Like  it, the boat fastened to it was whirled round with giddy  speed. I felt it. I felt the sick sensation that succeeds a  long-continued movement of gyration. We were horror-  stricken with suspended circulation, annihilated nervous  influence, covered with cold sweat like that of death !  What noise surrounded our fragile boat 1 What roaring,  which echo repeated at a distance of several miles ! What an  uproar was that of the water breaking on the sharp rocks at  the bottom, where the hardest bodies are broken, where the  trunks of trees are worn away, and are  made into fur,  according to a Norwegian saying I   What a situation ! We were frightfully tossed about.     UNDER THE SEA 319   The Nautilus defended itself like a human being. Its steel  muscles cracked. Sometimes it stood upright, and we with  it!    We must hold on and screw down the bolts again, said  Ned Land.  We may still be saved by keeping to the  Nautilus    He had not finished speaking when a crash took place.  The screws were torn out, and the boat, torn from its  groove, sprang like a stone from a sling into the midst of the  whirlpool.   My head struck on its iron framework, and with the  violent shock I lost all consciousness.     CHAPTER XXIII   CONCLUSION   So ended this voyage under the sea. What happened  during that night, how the boat escaped the formidable  eddies of the Maelstrom, how Ned Land, Conseil, and I got  out of the gulf, I have no idea. But when I came to myself  I was lying in the hut of a fisherman of the Loffoden Isles.  My two companions, safe and sound, were by my side press-  ing my hands. We shook hands heartily.   At this moment we cannot think of going back to France.  Means of communication between the north of Norway and  the south are rare. I am, therefore, obliged to wait for the  steamer that runs twice a month to Cape North.   It is here, therefore, amidst the honest folk who have  taken us in, that I revise the account of these adventures.  It is exact. Not a fact has been omitted, not a detail  exaggerated. It is a faithful narrative of an incredible  expedition in an element inaccessible to man, and to which  progress will one day open up a road.   Shall I be believed ? I do not know. After all, it  matters little. All I can now affirm is my right to speak  of the sea under which, in less than ten months, I journeyed  twenty thousand leagues during that submarine tour of  the world that has revealed so many marvels of the Pacific,     320 TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER SEA   the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, Mediterranean, Atlantic, and  the austral and boreal seas !   But what has become of the Nautilus ? Has it resisted  the pressure of the Maelstrom ? Is Captain Nemo still  alive ? Is he still pursuing his frightful vengeance under the  ocean, or did he stop before that last hecatomb ? Will the  waves one day bring the manuscript that contains the whole  history of his life ? Shall I know at last the name of the  man ? Will the ship that has disappeared tell us by its  nationality, the nationality of Captain Nemo ?   I hope so. I also hope that his powerful machine has  conquered the sea in its most terrible gulf, and that the  Nautilus has survived where so many other ships have  perished ! If it is so, if Captain Nemo still inhabits the  ocean, his adopted country, may hatred be appeased in his  savage heart ! May the contemplation of so many marvels  extinguish in him the desire of vengeance ! May the  judge disappear, and the scientist continue his peaceful  exploration of the sea ! If his destiny is strange, it is  sublime also. Have I not experienced it myself ? Have  I not lived ten months of this unnatural life ? Two men  only have a right to answer the question asked in the  Ecclesiastes 6,000 years ago.  That which is far off and  exceeding deep, who can find it out ?  These two men  are Captain Nemo and I.     THE END     WARD, LOCK  CO.'S   Royal Series   Foolscap Svo. Cloth. 1/6 Net. With Frontispiece and  Pictorial Envelope in Colour.
